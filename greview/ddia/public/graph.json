What makes this book important right now?</strong></p> <p>A. Hadoop has quickly become the standard for processing and analyzing Big Data. In order to integrate a new Hadoop deployment into your existing environment, you will need to transfer data stored in relational databases into Hadoop. Sqoop optimizes data transfers between Hadoop and databases with a command line interface listing 60 parameters. In this book, we'll focus on applying the parameters in common use cases to help you deploy and use Sqoop in your environment.</p> <p><strong>Q. What do you hope that readers of your book will walk away with?</strong></p> <p>A. One recipe at a time, this book guides you from basic commands not requiring prior Sqoop knowledge all the way to very advanced use cases. These recipes are detailed enough not only to enable you to deploy them within your environment but also to understand Sqoop's inner workings. </p> <p><strong>Q. Can you give us a little taste of the contents?</strong></p> <p>A. Imagine a scenario where you are incrementally importing records from MySQL into Hadoop. When you resume importing and noticing that some records have been modified, you also want to include those updated records. How do you drop the older copies of records when records have been updated and then merge in the newer copies?</p> <p>This sounds like a use-case for using the lastmodified incremental mode. Internally, the lastmodified import consists of two standalone MapReduce jobs. The first job will import the delta of changed data similarly to the way normal import does. This import job will save data in a temporary directory on HDFS. The second job will take both the old and new data and will merge them together into the final output, preserving only the last updated value for each row.</p> <p>Here's an example:</p> <p>sqoop import \\ </p> <p> --connect jdbc:mysql://mysql.example.com/sqoop \\ </p> <p> --username sqoop \\ </p> <p> --password sqoop \\ </p> <p> --table visits \\ </p> <p> --incremental lastmodified \\ </p> <p> --check-column last_update_date \\ </p> <p> --last-value \"2013-05-22 01:01:01\"</p> </div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Relational Databases","id":"3789"},{"name":"Storage & Retrieval","id":"10806617011"},{"name":"Database Storage & Design","id":"491306"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Kathleen Ting","Jarek Jarcec Cecho"],"Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"O'Reilly Media","EAN":"9781449364625","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781449364625"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"O Reilly Media","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1449364624","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"919","Length":"700","Weight":"36","Width":"19"},"Label":"O'Reilly Media","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$14.99"},"Manufacturer":"O'Reilly Media","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"94","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"30","Length":"900","Weight":"40","Width":"680"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2013-07-26","Publisher":"O'Reilly Media","ReleaseDate":"2013-07-23","Studio":"O'Reilly Media","Title":"Apache Sqoop Cookbook: Unlocking Hadoop for Your Relational Database"}}}},{"id":"1449368425","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1734,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.34"},"asin":"1449368425","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1449368425","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1449368425","salesRank":55780,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51khuKozg5L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51khuKozg5L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"327"},"title":"Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale (Lean (O'Reilly))","similar":["0321601912","1942788002","1942788339","1942788010","1942788290","1449335675","1942788118","0133903354","1449334911","0307887898"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1449368425&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A37Z&v=2&sig=M9TQfaNGqsebb1LFEQT7pZxzcxY18qtIxYE9Bd2vd5s%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><p>How well does your organization respond to changing market conditions, customer needs, and emerging technologies when building software-based products?

DDD tackles that complexity by focusing the team's attention on knowledge of the domain, picking apart the most tricky, intricate problems with models, and shaping the software around those models. Easier said than done! The techniques of DDD help us approach this systematically. <br> This reference gives a quick and authoritative summary of the key concepts of DDD. It is not meant as a learning introduction to the subject. Eric Evans' original book and a handful of others explain DDD in depth from different perspectives. On the other hand, we often need to scan a topic quickly or get the gist of a particular pattern. That is the purpose of this reference. It is complementary to the more discursive books. <br> The starting point of this text was a set of excerpts from the original book by Eric Evans, Domain-Driven-Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, 2004 - in particular, the pattern summaries, which were placed in the Creative Commons by Evans and the publisher, Pearson Education. In this reference, those original summaries have been updated and expanded with new content. <br> The practice and understanding of DDD has not stood still over the past decade, and Evans has taken this chance to document some important refinements. Some of the patterns and definitions have been edited or rewritten by Evans to clarify the original intent. Three patterns have been added, describing concepts whose usefulness and importance has emerged in the intervening years. Also, the sequence and grouping of the topics has been changed significantly to better emphasize the core principles. <br> This is an up-to-date, quick reference to DDD. <br></br> Eric Evans is the author of Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, 2004. He coined the term domain-driven design (DDD) and laid out its principles in that book. Since then he has continued to focus his energies in the area of DDD, teaching and continuing to apply DDD on real projects, as well as collaborating with other leaders in both the DDD community and the broader software development community."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Systems Analysis & Design","id":"602672"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Eric Evans","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781457501197","EANList":{"EANListElement":["0783324828771","8601418359333","9781457501197"]},"ISBN":"1457501198","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"551","Weight":"25","Width":"18"},"Label":"Dog Ear Publishing, LLC","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1495","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$14.95"},"Manufacturer":"Dog Ear Publishing, LLC","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"88","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"31","Length":"835","Weight":"2","Width":"543"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2014-09-22","Publisher":"Dog Ear Publishing, LLC","Studio":"Dog Ear Publishing, LLC","Title":"Domain-Driven Design Reference: Definitions and Pattern Summaries","UPC":"783324828771","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"783324828771"}}}}},{"id":"1479274836","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":3596,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$35.96"},"asin":"1479274836","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1479274836","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1479274836","salesRank":25548,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414Gsyd-S9L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414Gsyd-S9L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Elements of Programming Interviews: The Insiders' Guide","similar":["1537713949","0984782850","1517671272","111941847X","0262033844","0321334876","0201657880","1849967202","1491903996","1848000693"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1479274836&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A42Z&v=2&sig=nMoY%252FT%252FX1S9MRtHKeoogtUghJnbGGDtiHSKK084uFLo%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><div><div>Take great care to buy the latest version <b>bit.ly/buyingEPI</b></div></div><div></div><br /><div>EPI includes a framework for writing your solutions, as well as testing them against a comprehensive set of test-cases.

This edition of the book also covers printing, transitions and cloud-based file storage. <p> The concepts of material design are also covered in detail, including the use of floating action buttons, Snackbars, tabbed interfaces, card views, navigation drawers and collapsing toolbars. <p> In addition to covering general Android development techniques, the book also includes Google Play specific topics such as implementing maps using the Google Maps Android API, and submitting apps to the Google Play Developer Console. <p> Other key features of Android Studio 3 and Android 8 are also covered in detail including the Layout Editor, the ConstraintLayout and ConstraintSet classes, constraint chains and barriers, direct reply notifications and multi-window support. <p> Chapters also cover advanced features of Android Studio such as App Links, Instant Apps, the Android Studio Profiler and Gradle build configuration. <p> Assuming you already have some Java programming experience, are ready to download Android Studio and the Android SDK, have access to a Windows, Mac or Linux system and ideas for some apps to develop, you are ready to get started. <p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Programming","id":"3839"},{"name":"Programming & App Development","id":"377559011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Neil Smyth","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781977540096","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781977540096"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"1977540090","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"750","Width":"164"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"4599","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$45.99"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","NumberOfPages":"726","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"244","Length":"949","Weight":"299","Width":"917"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-09-25","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"Android Studio 3.0 Development Essentials - Android 8 Edition"}}}},{"id":"1979788782","data":{"width":56,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":3499,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$34.99"},"asin":"1979788782","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Simplified-Alvin-Alexander/dp/1979788782?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1979788782","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Simplified-Alvin-Alexander/dp/1979788782?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1979788782","salesRank":223284,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513OXgQ-SbL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"112"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513OXgQ-SbL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"350"},"title":"Functional Programming, Simplified: (Scala Edition)","similar":["0981531687","1491912219","1449339611","1617290653","0134540565","0134685997","1491936169","1449373321","1316626229","1617291013"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1979788782&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A40Z&v=2&sig=yXDW7wU1fgsCHvf1LKaSCqh8jthJd3Z8F8BhqjWLPlM%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>If you’ve had trouble trying to learn Functional Programming (FP), you’re not alone. In this book, Alvin Alexander — author of the <em>Scala Cookbook</em> and former teacher of Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) classes — writes about his own problems in trying to understand FP, and how he finally conquered it.</p> <p>What he originally learned is that experienced FP developers are driven by two goals: to use only immutable values, and write only pure functions. What he later learned is that they have these goals as the result of another larger goal: they want all of their code to look and work just like algebra.</p> <p>While that sounds simple, it turns out that these goals require them to use many advanced Scala features — which they often use all at the same time. As a result, their code can look completely foreign to novice FP developers. As Mr. Alexander writes, “When you first see their code it’s easy to ask, ‘Why would anyone write code like this?’”</p> <p>Mr. Alexander answers that “Why?” question by explaining the benefits of writing pure functional code. Once you understand those benefits — your motivation for learning FP — he shares five rules for programming in the book:</p> <ul> <li>All fields must be immutable (‘val’ fields).</li> <li>All functions must be pure functions.</li> <li>Null values are not allowed.</li> <li>Whenever you use an ‘if’ you must also use an ‘else’.</li> <li>You won’t create OOP classes that encapsulate data and behavior; instead you’ll design data structures using Scala ‘case’ classes, and write pure functions that operate on those data structures.</li> </ul> <p>In the book you’ll see how those five, simple rules naturally lead you to write pure, functional code that reads like algebra. He also shares one more Golden Rule for learning:</p> <ul> <li>Always ask “Why”?</li> </ul> <p>Lessons in the book include:</p> <ul> <li>How and why to write only pure functions</li> <li>Why pure function signatures are much more important than OOP method signatures</li> <li>Why recursion is a natural tool for functional programming, and how to write recursive algorithms</li> <li>Because the Scala ‘for’ expression is so important to FP, dozens of pages explain the details of how it works</li> <li>In the end you’ll see that monads aren’t that difficult because they’re a natural extension of the Five Rules</li> <li>The book finishes with lessons on FP data modeling, and two main approaches for organizing your pure functions</li> </ul> <p>As Mr. Alexander writes, “In this book I take the time to explain all of the concepts that are used to write FP code in Scala. As I learned from my own experience, once you understand the Five Rules and the small concepts, you can understand Scala/FP.”</p> <p>Please note that because of the limits on how large a printed book can be, the paperback version does not include all of the chapters that are in the Kindle eBook. The following lessons <em>are not</em> in the paperback version:</p> <ul> <li>Grandma’s Cookies (a story about pure functions)</li> <li>The ScalaCheck lessons</li> <li>The Type Classes lessons</li> <li>The appendices</li> </ul> <p>Because those lessons didn’ fit in the print version, they have been made freely available online.</p> <p>(Alvin Alexander (alvinalexander.com) wrote the popular <em>Scala Cookbook</em> for O’Reilly, and also self-published two other books, <em>How I Sold My Business: A Personal Diary</em>, and <em>A Survival Guide for New Consultants</em>.)</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Functional","id":"132561011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Alvin Alexander","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781979788786","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781979788786"},"ISBN":"1979788782","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1000","Length":"700","Width":"176"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$34.99"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","NumberOfPages":"780","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"176","Length":"1000","Weight":"361","Width":"700"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-12-07","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"Functional Programming, Simplified: (Scala Edition)"}}}},{"id":"149192912X","data":{"width":61,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2948,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$29.48"},"asin":"149192912X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems/dp/149192912X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=149192912X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems/dp/149192912X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=149192912X","salesRank":8356,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RT0Hlr4zL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"122"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RT0Hlr4zL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"381"},"title":"Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems","similar":["1492029505","1942788002","1491957352","1491935677","1449373321","1942788339","1942788290","1491983647","1491977086","1491926309"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=149192912X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A34Z&v=2&sig=7vDgVqO9G7FjAA3inDGj5MY924k5C9AH45xfkA9HiOc%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><p>The overwhelming majority of a software system’s lifespan is spent in use, not in design or implementation.

Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace.

Starting with thefundamental elements of the language, Programming in Scala introducesfunctional programming from the practitioner's perspective, anddescribes advanced language features that can make you a better, moreproductive developer."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Computer Science","id":"3508"},{"name":"Object-Oriented Design","id":"4013"},{"name":"Software Development","id":"4016"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"3952"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Martin Odersky","Lex Spoon","Bill Venners"],"Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"imusti","EAN":"9780981531687","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780981531687"},"Edition":"3","Feature":"CBL Distribution","ISBN":"0981531687","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"950","Length":"700","Weight":"300","Width":"175"},"Label":"Artima Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"French","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"5495","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$54.95"},"Manufacturer":"Artima Press","NumberOfPages":"837","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"220","Length":"920","Weight":"265","Width":"700"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-05-10","Publisher":"Artima Press","Studio":"Artima Press","Title":"Programming in Scala: Updated for Scala 2.12"}}}},{"id":"0134540565","data":{"width":60.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":3610,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$36.10"},"asin":"0134540565","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Scala-Impatient-2nd-Cay-Horstmann/dp/0134540565?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0134540565","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Scala-Impatient-2nd-Cay-Horstmann/dp/0134540565?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0134540565","salesRank":176076,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514y-sLRbkL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"121"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514y-sLRbkL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"377"},"title":"Scala for the Impatient (2nd Edition)","similar":["0981531687","1617290653","1491912219","1491943203","1449339611","1449358624","1491972955","1491936169","1979788782","1449373321"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0134540565&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A35Z&v=2&sig=xOSx%252Fz6zh%252By8KGxqt6IeYreoU%252FORWJZGowqLzXYEg2E%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<!--[if gte mso 9]> <xml> </xml> <![endif]--> <p style=\"margin:0px;\">Interest in the Scala programming language continues to grow for many reasons. Scala embraces the functional programming style without abandoning the object-oriented paradigm, and it allows you to write programs more concisely than in Java. Because Scala runs on the JVM, it can access any Java library and is interoperable with familiar Java frameworks. Scala also makes it easier to leverage the full power of concurrency. </p> <p style=\"margin:0px;\"> <br> </p> <p style=\"margin:0px;\">Written for experienced Java, C++, or C# programmers who are new to Scala or functional programming, <i> <b>Scala for the Impatient, Second Edition,</b> </i> introduces the key Scala concepts and techniques you need in order to be productive quickly. It is the perfect introduction to the language, particularly for impatient readers who want to learn the fundamentals of Scala so they can start coding quickly. It doesn’t attempt to exhaustively list all the features of the language or make you suffer through long and contrived examples. Instead, carefully crafted examples and hands-on activities guide you through well-defined stages of competency, from basic to expert. </p> <p style=\"margin:0px;\"> <br> </p> <p style=\"margin:0px;\">This revised edition has been thoroughly updated for Scala 2.12 and reflects current Scala usage. It includes added coverage of recent Scala features, including string interpolation, dynamic invocation, implicit classes, and futures.

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.

Today refactoring requires considerable design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be able to improve their code using refactoring techniques.<p> Besides an introduction to refactoring, this handbook provides a catalog of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about <I>Refactoring</I> is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip is presented with a simple name, a \"motivation,\" and examples using Java and UML.) <p> Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring. (When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After the discussion on how to detect the \"smell\" of bad code, readers get to the heart of the book, its catalog of over 70 \"refactorings\"--tips for better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with \"before\" and \"after\" code, along with an explanation.

Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn't taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In <I>The Pragmatic Programmer</I>, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they've discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code.<p> Some of the authors' nuggets of pragmatism are concrete, and the path to their implementation is clear. They advise readers to learn one text editor, for example, and use it for everything. They also recommend the use of version-tracking software for even the smallest projects, and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a text-manipulation language. Other (perhaps more valuable) advice is more light-hearted. In the debugging section, it is noted that, \"if you see hoof prints think horses, not zebras.\" That is, suspect everything, but start looking for problems in the most obvious places. There are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense, and for integrating testing into the development process. You'll want a copy of <I>The Pragmatic Programmer</I> for two reasons: it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered. Working programmers will enjoy this book. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: A useful approach to software design and construction that allows for efficient, profitable development of high-quality products. Elements of the approach include specification development, customer relations, team management, design practices, development tools, and testing procedures. This approach is presented with the help of anecdotes and technical problems."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Programming","id":"3839"},{"name":"Software","id":"4053"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Andrew Hunt","David Thomas"],"Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Color":"Black","EAN":"9780201616224","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601404321023","8601200967302","0785342616224","9780201616224","8580001062365","0787721898825"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Addison-Wesley Professional","ISBN":"020161622X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"920","Length":"735","Weight":"141","Width":"105"},"Label":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"4999","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$49.99"},"Manufacturer":"Addison-Wesley Professional","MPN":"978-0-2016-1622-4","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"352","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"79","Length":"925","Weight":"134","Width":"748"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"978-0-2016-1622-4","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1999-10-30","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Studio":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","UPC":"787721898825","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":["787721898825","785342616224"]}}}}},{"id":"0131177052","data":{"width":60.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":5200,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$52.00"},"asin":"0131177052","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0131177052","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0131177052","salesRank":49185,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513zbr3tilL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"121"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513zbr3tilL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"379"},"title":"Working Effectively with Legacy Code","similar":["0201485672","0132350882","0134494164","020161622X","0321146530","0137081073","0201633612","0321503627","0321213351","0321125215"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0131177052&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A37Z&v=2&sig=XBpR19dBfAyz37TAX%252FijwZPvSIYs4qHojBMzWGQYUKg%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"In this book, Michael Feathers offers start-to-finish strategies for working more effectively with large, untested legacy code bases.

It is more than experience or innate ability. Expert software designers have specific habits, learned practices, and observed principles that they apply deliberately during their design work. This book offers sixty-six insights, distilled from years of studying experts at work, that capture what successful software designers actually do to create great software. </P><P>The book presents these insights in a series of two-page illustrated spreads, with the principle and a short explanatory text on one page, and a drawing on the facing page.

Written in a fast-paced thriller style, The Goal, a gripping novel, is transforming management thinking throughout the world. It is a book to recommend to your friends in industry - even to your bosses - but not to your competitors. Alex Rogo is a harried plant manager working ever more desperately to try improve performance. His factory is rapidly heading for disaster. So is his marriage. He has ninety days to save his plant - or it will be closed by corporate HQ, with hundreds of job losses. It takes a chance meeting with a professor from student days - Jonah - to help him break out of conventional ways of thinking to see what needs to be done. The story of Alex's fight to save his plant is more than compulsive reading. It contains a serious message for all managers in industry and explains the ideas, which underline the Theory of Constraints (TOC), developed by Eli Goldratt.<p><br>One of Eli Goldratt s convictions was that the goal of an individual or an organization should not be defined in absolute terms. A good definition of a goal is one that sets us on a path of ongoing improvement.<br>Pursuing such a goal necessitates more than one breakthrough. In fact it requires many. To be in a position to identify these breakthroughs we should have a deep understanding of the underlying rules of our environment. Twenty-five years after writing The Goal, Dr. Goldratt wrote Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. In this article he provided the underlying rules of operations.

And now it’s starting to spread to every domain where leaders wrestle with complex projects.<br>  <br>If you’ve ever been startled by how fast the world is changing, Scrum is one of the reasons why. Productivity gains of as much as 1200% have been recorded, and there’s no more lucid – or <i>compelling </i>– explainer of Scrum and its bright promise than Jeff Sutherland, the man who put together the first Scrum team more than twenty years ago.<br>  <br>The thorny problem Jeff began tackling back then boils down to this: people are spectacularly bad at doing things with agility and efficiency. Best laid plans go up in smoke. Teams often work at cross purposes to each other. And when the pressure rises, unhappiness soars. Drawing on his experience as a West Point-educated fighter pilot, biometrics expert, early innovator of ATM technology, and V.P. of engineering or CTO at eleven different technology companies, Jeff began challenging those dysfunctional realities, looking  for solutions that would have global impact.<br>  <br>In this book you’ll journey to Scrum’s front lines where Jeff’s system of deep accountability, team interaction, and constant iterative improvement is, among other feats, bringing the FBI into the 21st century, perfecting the design of an affordable 140 mile per hour/100 mile per gallon car, helping NPR report fast-moving action in the Middle East, changing the way pharmacists interact with patients, reducing poverty in the Third World, and even helping people plan their weddings and accomplish weekend chores. <br>  <br>Woven with insights from martial arts, judicial decision making, advanced aerial combat, robotics, and many other disciplines, Scrum is consistently riveting. But the most important reason to read this book is that it may just help you achieve what others consider unachievable – whether it be inventing a trailblazing technology, devising a new system of education, pioneering a way to feed the hungry, or, closer to home, a building a foundation for your family to thrive and prosper."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Business","id":"8298060011"},{"name":"Time Management","id":"2569"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Jeff Sutherland","JJ Sutherland"],"Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Crown Business","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"XM-038534645X"},"EAN":"9780385346450","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601410683535","0884226632654","8601420561410","8601411343339","9780385346450"]},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"Crown Business","ISBN":"038534645X","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"950","Length":"650","Weight":"100","Width":"100"},"Label":"Currency","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Currency","MPN":"9780385346450","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"256","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"940","Weight":"100","Width":"630"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780385346450","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2014-09-30","Publisher":"Currency","ReleaseDate":"2014-09-30","Studio":"Currency","Title":"Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time","TradeInValue":{"Amount":"227","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$2.27"},"UPC":"884226632654","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"884226632654"}}}}},{"id":"098639341X","data":{"width":61.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1999,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$19.99"},"asin":"098639341X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ansible-DevOps-Server-configuration-management/dp/098639341X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=098639341X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ansible-DevOps-Server-configuration-management/dp/098639341X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=098639341X","salesRank":221441,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fh7tZ5cXL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"123"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fh7tZ5cXL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"384"},"title":"Ansible for DevOps: Server and configuration management for humans","similar":["1491979801","1491977086","1521822808","1521823634","1784398292","1491924357","1491915323","1787125688","1491935677","1942788002"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=098639341X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A40Z&v=2&sig=CP1FLTjywIPHSlaqXbt8DnoXsGqWlTNu3wXTQLGu3oQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Covers Ansible 2.0! <br><br>Ansible is a simple, but powerful, server and configuration management tool (with a few other tricks up its sleeve).

One of its most powerful capabilities is the built-in support for threads. This makes concurrent programming an attractive yet challenging option for programmers using the Java programming language. This book shows readers how to use the Java platforms threading model more precisely by helping them to understand the patterns and tradeoffs associated with concurrent programming. You will learn how to initiate, control, and coordinate concurrent activities using the class java.lang.Thread, the keywords synchronized and volatile, and the methods wait, notify, and notifyAll. In addition, you will find detailed coverage of all aspects of concurrent programming, including such topics as confinement and synchronization, deadlocks and conflicts, state-dependent action control, asynchronous message passing and control flow, coordinated interaction, and structuring web-based and compu"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<I>Concurrent Programming in Java, 2nd Edition</I> surveys a wide field of research in parallelism and concurrency and shows how to do more with multithreading in Java with dozens of patterns and design tips. Written for the advanced Java developer, this book offers a comprehensive tour of leading-edge thinking about parallel coding processes.<p> Within the dozens of techniques and tips offered here, this book accomplishes at least two goals. First, it shows how concurrency is implemented by default within Java, with material on how built-in features (like the <I>synchronized</I> keyword and its memory model) can be expected to perform when dealing with multiple threads. Naturally, Java threads themselves are also covered, including priorities, scheduling, and the like. <p> Much of this book looks at ways to improve performance of concurrent code beyond the simple default strategies. After defining criteria for measuring concurrent code (such as safety and \"liveness,\" a measure of running live threads effectively), the book presents dozens of techniques for letting threads work together safely. For the working Java programmer, coverage of patterns that have been implemented in the downloadable <I>java.concurrency</I> package will be the most immediately useful. (Within this nearly encyclopedic survey, short code snippets are used for every pattern and concept.) <p>Though theoretical at times, this book offers plenty of ideas and sample code to get you started thinking of ways to improve multithreaded code. <p> Impressively comprehensive, <I>Concurrent Programming in Java</I> offers a veritable bible of techniques for doing two things at once with threads in Java. It's a worthwhile guide to the state-of-the-art strategies for improving the performance of your Java threads. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Threads and concurrency in Java, design considerations (safety, liveness, and performance), Before/After Patterns, layering, adapters, immutability and synchronization, deadlock, resource ordering, the Java Memory Model and concurrency, using the <I>java.concurrency</I> package, confinement, refactoring for concurrency, mutexes, read-write locks, recovering from failure, notifications, semaphores, latches, exchanges, transactions, one-way messages, worker threads, polling and event-driven I/O, parallelism techniques (fork/join, computation trees, and barriers), Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Programming","id":"3839"},{"name":"Software","id":"4053"},{"name":"Java","id":"3608"},{"name":"Mathematics","id":"13884"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Doug Lea","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780201310092","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780201310092","0785342310092"]},"Edition":"2","ISBN":"0201310090","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"890","Length":"730","Weight":"146","Width":"110"},"Label":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"7499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$74.99"},"Manufacturer":"Addison-Wesley Professional","MPN":"Illustrations","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"432","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"94","Length":"913","Weight":"163","Width":"740"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"Illustrations","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1999-11-04","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-25","Studio":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Title":"Concurrent Programming in Java™: Design Principles and Pattern, 2nd Edition","UPC":"785342310092","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"785342310092"}}}}},{"id":"0596009208","data":{"width":69,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":3551,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$35.51"},"asin":"0596009208","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0596009208","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0596009208","salesRank":14985,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gsycdh-TL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"138"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gsycdh-TL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"432"},"title":"Head First Java, 2nd Edition","similar":["0596007124","1259589315","1491919531","0596008678","1539397831","0134685997","1259589331","0134706056","1449362184","144934013X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0596009208&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A40Z&v=2&sig=iH9v1mzm5nLvHjgXtClp9IFPANVfNT8ZotTB4YmJzSY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java. You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study.<br /><br /> The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows.<br /><br /> And that's how your brain will learn Java. <em>Head First Java</em> combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever.<br /><br /> If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.<br /><br /> By exploiting how your brain works, <em>Head First Java</em> compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Certification","id":"3448"},{"name":"Computer Science","id":"3508"},{"name":"Object-Oriented Design","id":"4013"},{"name":"Software","id":"4053"},{"name":"Java","id":"3608"},{"name":"Object-Oriented Software Design","id":"491310"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Kathy Sierra","Bert Bates"],"Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Sierra, Kathy/ Bates, Bert","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"AL12133143"},"EAN":"9780596009205","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601404235726","8601419449606","9780596009205","8601300354446"]},"Edition":"2nd","Feature":"O Reilly Media","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0596009208","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"800","Weight":"313","Width":"148"},"Label":"O'Reilly Media","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"4495","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$44.95"},"Manufacturer":"O'Reilly Media","MPN":"978-0-596-00920-5","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"688","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"140","Length":"920","Weight":"315","Width":"800"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"978-0-596-00920-5","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2005-02-19","Publisher":"O'Reilly Media","ReleaseDate":"2005-02-09","Studio":"O'Reilly Media","Title":"Head First Java, 2nd Edition"}}}},{"id":"0134177304","data":{"width":62.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":4729,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$47.29"},"asin":"0134177304","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-I-Fundamentals-10th/dp/0134177304?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0134177304","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-I-Fundamentals-10th/dp/0134177304?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0134177304","salesRank":43597,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dHD22LDJL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"125"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dHD22LDJL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"392"},"title":"Core Java Volume I--Fundamentals (10th Edition) (Core Series)","similar":["0134177290","0134685997","1259589331","0596009208","0131872486","0321349601","0321996321","0672324539","0321356683","0131489062"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0134177304&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A40Z&v=2&sig=TldHzbZRMpLo0nvzYi4Lfs5g7d%252BR6HBbu31BcjcHlvg%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p style=\"margin:0px;\"> <i>Core Java®</i> has long been recognized as the leading, no-nonsense tutorial and reference for experienced programmers who want to write robust Java code for real-world applications.

If you are seriously interested in understanding how you and your team can start down the path of improvement with XP, you must read this book.”<br> <br>—<b>Francesco Cirillo,</b> Chief Executive Officer, XPLabs S.R.L. </blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“The first edition of this book told us what XP was—it changed the way many of us think about software development. This second edition takes it farther and gives us a lot more of the ‘why’ of XP, the motivations and the principles behind the practices. This is great stuff. Armed with the ‘what’ and the ‘why,’ we can now all set out to confidently work on the ‘how’: how to run our projects better, and how to get agile techniques adopted in our organizations.”<br> <br>—<b>Dave Thomas,</b> The Pragmatic Programmers LLC </blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“This book is dynamite! It was revolutionary when it first appeared a few years ago, and this new edition is equally profound. For those who insist on cookbook checklists, there’s an excellent chapter on ‘primary practices,’ but I urge you to begin by truly contemplating the meaning of the opening sentence in the first chapter of Kent Beck’s book: ‘XP is about social change.’ You should do whatever it takes to ensure that every IT professional and every IT manager—all the way up to the CIO—has a copy of <i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> on his or her desk.”<br> <br> —<b>Ed Yourdon,</b> author and consultant </blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“XP is a powerful set of concepts for simplifying the process of software design, development, and testing. It is about minimalism and incrementalism, which are especially useful principles when tackling complex problems that require a balance of creativity and discipline.”<br> <br> —<b>Michael A. Cusumano,</b> Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of <i>The Business of Software</i> </blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“<i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> is the work of a talented and passionate craftsman. Kent Beck has brought together a compelling collection of ideas about programming and management that deserves your full attention. My only beef is that our profession has gotten to a point where such common-sense ideas are labeled ‘extreme.’...”<br> <br> —<b>Lou Mazzucchelli,</b> Fellow, Cutter Business Technology Council</blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“If your organization is ready for a change in the way it develops software, there’s the slow incremental approach, fixing things one by one, or the fast track, jumping feet first into Extreme Programming. Do not be frightened by the name, it is not that extreme at all. It is mostly good old recipes and common sense, nicely integrated together, getting rid of all the fat that has accumulated over the years.”<br> <br> —<b>Philippe Kruchten,</b> UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia</blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“Sometimes revolutionaries get left behind as the movement they started takes on a life of its own. In this book, Kent Beck shows that he remains ahead of the curve, leading XP to its next level. Incorporating five years of feedback, this book takes a fresh look at what it takes to develop better software in less time and for less money. There are no silver bullets here, just a set of practical principles that, when used wisely, can lead to dramatic improvements in software development productivity.”<br> <br> —<b>Mary Poppendieck,</b> author of <i>Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</i> </blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“Kent Beck has revised his classic book based on five more years of applying and teaching XP. He shows how the path to XP is both easy and hard: It can be started with fewer practices, and yet it challenges teams to go farther than ever.”<br> <br> —<b>William Wake,</b> independent consultant </blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“With new insights, wisdom from experience, and clearer explanations of the art of Extreme Programming, this edition of Beck’s classic will help many realize the dream of outstanding software development.”<br> <br>—<b>Joshua Kerievsky,</b> author of <i>Refactoring to Patterns</i> and Founder, Industrial Logic, Inc.</blockquote> <BLOCKQUOTE>“XP has changed the way our industry thinks about software development. Its brilliant simplicity, focused execution, and insistence on fact-based planning over speculation have set a new standard for software delivery.”<br> <br>—<b>David Trowbridge, </b>Architect, Microsoft Corporation</blockquote> <p>Accountability. Transparency. Responsibility. These are not words that are often applied to software development. </p> <p>In this completely revised introduction to Extreme Programming (XP), Kent Beck describes how to improve your software development by integrating these highly desirable concepts into your daily development process.</p> <p>The first edition of <i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> is a classic. It won awards for its then-radical ideas for improving small-team development, such as having developers write automated tests for their own code and having the whole team plan weekly. Much has changed in five years. This completely rewritten second edition expands the scope of XP to teams of any size by suggesting a program of continuous improvement based on:</p> <ul> <li>Five core values consistent with excellence in software development</li> <li>Eleven principles for putting those values into action</li> <li>Thirteen primary and eleven corollary practices to help you push development past its current business and technical limitations</li> </ul> <p>Whether you have a small team that is already closely aligned with your customers or a large team in a gigantic or multinational organization, you will find in these pages a wealth of ideas to challenge, inspire, and encourage you and your team members to substantially improve your software development. </p> <p>You will discover how to:</p> <ul> <li>Involve the whole team—XP style</li> <li>Increase technical collaboration through pair programming and continuous integration</li> <li>Reduce defects through developer testing</li> <li>Align business and technical decisions through weekly and quarterly planning</li> <li>Improve teamwork by setting up an informative, shared workspace</li> </ul> <p>You will also find many other concrete ideas for improvement, all based on a philosophy that emphasizes simultaneously increasing the humanity and effectiveness of software development.</p> <p>Every team can improve. Every team can begin improving today. Improvement is possible—beyond what we can currently imagine. <b> <i>Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition,</i> </b> offers ideas to fuel your improvement for years to come.</p> <br> <br> </P>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Software Development","id":"4016"},{"name":"Software","id":"4053"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"3952"},{"name":"Software Design & Engineering","id":"491316"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Kent Beck","Cynthia Andres"],"Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Beck, Kent/ Andres, Cynthia/ Gamma, Erich (FRW)","EAN":"9780321278654","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780321278654","8601406081345","8601419379415","0785342278651"]},"Edition":"2nd","ISBN":"0321278658","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"910","Length":"730","Weight":"88","Width":"70"},"Label":"Addison-Wesley","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"4499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$44.99"},"Manufacturer":"Addison-Wesley","MPN":"9780321278654","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"224","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"55","Length":"913","Weight":"88","Width":"740"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780321278654","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2004-11-26","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-16","Studio":"Addison-Wesley","Title":"Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition (The XP Series)","UPC":"785342278651","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"785342278651"}}}}},{"id":"0321503627","data":{"width":61,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":4928,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$49.28"},"asin":"0321503627","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321503627","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321503627","salesRank":100577,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fUKOog3VL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"122"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fUKOog3VL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"382"},"title":"Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests","similar":["0321146530","0131177052","0201485672","0132350882","0134494164","0321125215","0321127420","0131495054","0321601912","0137081073"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0321503627&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-17T06%3A13%3A43Z&v=2&sig=gEbMH1hVWQBRjkGn%252BkRann8qw59WxCvcICxCI7i%252Bf8M%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\">Foreword by Kent Beck</P> <P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\"> <B> </B> </P> <P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\"> <I>\"The authors of this book have led a revolution in the craft of programming by controlling the environment in which software grows.” </I>--Ward Cunningham</P> <P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\"> <I> </I> </P> <P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\"> <I>“At last, a book suffused with code that exposes the deep symbiosis between TDD and OOD.
