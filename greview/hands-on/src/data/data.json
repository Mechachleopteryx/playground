It reinvents industries and runs the world. Companies, governments, law enforcement, hospitals, and universities are seizing upon the power. These institutions predict whether you're going to click, buy, lie, or die.<br /><br /> Why? For good reason: predicting human behavior combats risk, boosts sales, fortifies healthcare, streamlines manufacturing, conquers spam, optimizes social networks, toughens crime fighting, and wins elections.<br /><br /> How? Prediction is powered by the world's most potent, flourishing <i>unnatural</i> resource: data. Accumulated in large part as the by-product of routine tasks, data is the unsalted, flavorless residue deposited en masse as organizations churn away. Surprise! This heap of refuse is a gold mine. <i>Big data</i> embodies an extraordinary wealth of experience from which to learn.<br /><i><br /></i>Predictive analytics<i> </i>(aka machine learning) unleashes the power of data. With this technology<i>,</i> the computer literally learns from data how to predict the future behavior of individuals. Perfect prediction is not possible, but putting odds on the future drives millions of decisions more effectively, determining whom to call, mail, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate.<br /><br /> In this lucid, captivating introduction — <i>now in its Revised and Updated edition</i> — former Columbia University professor and Predictive Analytics World founder Eric Siegel reveals the power and perils of prediction:</p> <ul> <li>What type of mortgage risk Chase Bank predicted before the recession.</li> <li>Predicting which people will drop out of school, cancel a subscription, or get divorced before they even know it themselves.</li> <li>Why early retirement predicts a shorter life expectancy and vegetarians miss fewer flights.</li> <li>Five reasons why organizations predict death — including one health insurance company.</li> <li>How U.S. Bank and Obama for America calculated the way to most strongly persuade each individual.</li> <li>Why the NSA wants all your data: machine learning supercomputers to fight terrorism.</li> <li>How IBM's Watson computer used <i>predictive modeling</i> to answer questions and beat the human champs on TV's <i>Jeopardy!</i></li> <li>How companies ascertain untold, private truths — how Target figures out you're pregnant and Hewlett-Packard deduces you're about to quit your job.</li> <li>How judges and parole boards rely on crime-predicting computers to decide how long convicts remain in prison.</li> <li>182 examples from Airbnb, the BBC, Citibank, ConEd, Facebook, Ford, Google, the IRS, LinkedIn, Match.com, MTV, Netflix, PayPal, Pfizer, Spotify, Uber, UPS, Wikipedia, and more. </li> </ul> <p>How does predictive analytics work?

Why is your book timely?</strong></p> <p>A. Interest in R for data analysis and visualization has exploded in recent years. In the computer-tech world, computers and networks have made it much easier to gather and organize data, and more and more people have recognized that there's useful information to be found. To illustrate, consider the job \"data scientist\": this is a job title that didn't even exist five years ago, and now it's one of the hottest tickets on the market. </p> <p>At the same time, there's been a swell of interest in R in its more traditional setting, in science and engineering. I think there are many reasons for this. One, is that there's a growing recognition outside of the computer-programmer world that learning a little programming can save you a lot of time and reduce errors. Another reason is that the last few years have seen an improvement in the user-friendliness of tools for using R.</p> <p>So there's a lot of interest in using R for finding information in data, and visualization an essential tool for doing this. Data visualizations can help you understand your data and find patterns when you're in the exploratory phase of data analysis, and they are essential for communicating your findings to others. </p> <p><strong>Q. What information do you hope that readers of your book will walk away with?</strong></p> <p>A. As my book is a Cookbook, the primary goal is to efficiently present solutions for visualizing data, without demanding a large investment of time from the reader. For many readers, the goal is to just figure out how to make a particular type of graph and be done with it.</p> <p>There are others who will want to gain a deeper understanding of how graphing works in R. For these readers, I've written an appendix on the graphing package ggplot2, which is used extensively in the recipes in the book. This appendix explains some of the concepts in the grammar of graphics, and how they relate to structures common to data visualizations in general.</p> <p>Finally, I hope that readers will find ideas and inspiration for visualizing their data by browsing the pages and looking at the pictures. </p> <p><strong>Q. What's the most exciting/important thing happening in your space?</strong></p> <p>A. I'm excited that R is becoming more and more accessible to users who don't primarily identify as programmers. Many scientists, engineers, and data analysts have outgrown programs that provide canned data analysis routines, and they're turning increasingly to R. The growing popularity of R is part of a virtuous circle: as R gains a larger user base, it encourages people to create better educational materials and programming tools for R, which in turn helps to grow the number of R users.</p> <p>Technology-wise, I'm excited by Shiny, which is a framework for bringing R analyses to the web. (I should mention that this it's part of my job to work on the development of Shiny.) This makes it possible to build interactive applications for data analysis and visualization for users who don't need to know R, or even that the application is backed by R. </p> </div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Computer Science","id":"3508"},{"name":"Data Modeling & Design","id":"379382011"},{"name":"Software Development","id":"4016"},{"name":"Mathematical & Statistical","id":"271582011"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","id":"760204"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Winston Chang","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"O Reilly Media","EAN":"9781449316952","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781449316952"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"O Reilly Media","ISBN":"1449316956","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"919","Length":"700","Weight":"165","Width":"90"},"Label":"O'Reilly Media","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"O'Reilly Media","MPN":"35561483","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"416","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"90","Length":"910","Weight":"165","Width":"690"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"35561483","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2013-01-06","Publisher":"O'Reilly Media","Studio":"O'Reilly Media","Title":"R Graphics Cookbook: Practical Recipes for Visualizing Data"}}}},{"id":"1449319793","data":{"width":61,"height":80,"product":{"asin":"1449319793","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1449319793","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1449319793","salesRank":144518,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515XdK-YtFL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"122"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515XdK-YtFL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"381"},"title":"Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython","similar":["149190142X","1449359361","1449357105","1412988012","1491962291","1449369413","1783555130","1491910291","1617291382","1491912057"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1449319793&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-11T06%3A32%3A59Z&v=2&sig=XJvwBgpbBFHzCrX%252BFTSfNFM8snzSmZGyhWJmTpoXY1E%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><p><i>Python for Data Analysis</i> is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python.

Neural networks are a key element of deep learning and artificial intelligence, which today is capable of some truly impressive feats. Yet too few really understand how neural networks actually work. This guide will take you on a fun and unhurried journey, starting from very simple ideas, and gradually building up an understanding of how neural networks work. You won't need any mathematics beyond secondary school, and an accessible introduction to calculus is also included. The ambition of this guide is to make neural networks as accessible as possible to as many readers as possible - there are enough texts for advanced readers already! You'll learn to code in Python and make your own neural network, teaching it to recognise human handwritten numbers, and performing as well as professionally developed networks. Part 1 is about ideas. We introduce the mathematical ideas underlying the neural networks, gently with lots of illustrations and examples. Part 2 is practical. We introduce the popular and easy to learn Python programming language, and gradually builds up a neural network which can learn to recognise human handwritten numbers, easily getting it to perform as well as networks made by professionals. Part 3 extends these ideas further. We push the performance of our neural network to an industry leading 98% using only simple ideas and code, test the network on your own handwriting, take a privileged peek inside the mysterious mind of a neural network, and even get it all working on a Raspberry Pi. All the code in this has been tested to work on a Raspberry Pi Zero."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Neural Networks","id":"3896"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Tariq Rashid","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Rashid Tariq","EAN":"9781530826605","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781530826605"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Make Your Own Neural Network","ISBN":"1530826608","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1100","Length":"850","Weight":"158","Width":"53"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","MPN":"Illustrated","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"222","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"83","Length":"1098","Weight":"158","Width":"850"},"PartNumber":"Illustrated","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-03-31","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"Make Your Own Neural Network"}}}},{"id":"1549617214","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"asin":"1549617214","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Absolute-Beginners-Introduction/dp/1549617214?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1549617214","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Absolute-Beginners-Introduction/dp/1549617214?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1549617214","salesRank":21998,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51grC6mjPSL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51grC6mjPSL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Machine Learning For Absolute Beginners: A Plain English Introduction (Machine Learning For Beginners)","similar":["1549869132","1549893750","1549761749","9811110689","1549893645","1491962291","1720649499","1787125939","1119467659","1119245516"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1549617214&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-11T06%3A32%3A52Z&v=2&sig=pCwk72xyqM48AG4viwIVU9l8H8CbCT0im1pvhJ3pBUQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>Please note that this book is not a sequel to the First Edition, but rather a restructured and revamped version of the First Edition.</b> </br> </br> <h2>Ready to crank up a virtual server and smash through petabytes of data?

What is it used for and how does it fit within the broader arena of machine learning?</p> <p>we gently explore these topics so that we can be prepared to dive deep further on. To start, we’ll begin with a high-level overview of machine learning and then drill down into the specifics of a neural network.</p> <h2>The Math of Neural Networks</h2> <p>On a high level, a network learns just like we do, through trial and error. This is true regardless if the network is supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised. Once we dig a bit deeper though, we discover that a handful of mathematical functions play a major role in the trial and error process. It also becomes clear that a grasp of the underlying mathematics helps clarify how a network learns.</p> * Forward Propagation * Calculating The Total Error * Calculating The Gradients * Updating The Weights <h2>Make Your Own Artificial Neural Network: Hands on Example</h2> <p>You will learn to build a simple neural network using all the concepts and functions we learned in the previous few chapters. Our example will be basic but hopefully very intuitive. Many examples available online are either hopelessly abstract or make use of the same data sets, which can be repetitive. Our goal is to be crystal clear and engaging, but with a touch of fun and uniqueness. This section contains the following eight chapters.</p> <h2>Building Neural Networks in Python</h2> <p>There are many ways to build a neural network and lots of tools to get the job done. This is fantastic, but it can also be overwhelming when you start, because there are so many tools to choose from. We are going to take a look at what tools are needed and help you nail down the essentials. To build a neural network</p> <h3>Tensorflow and Neural Networks</h3> <p>There is no single way to build a feedforward neural network with Python, and that is especially true if you throw Tensorflow into the mix. However, there is a general framework that exists that can be divided into five steps and grouped into two parts. We are going to briefly explore these five steps so that we are prepared to use them to build a network later on. Ready? Let’s begin.</p> <h3>Neural Network: Distinguish Handwriting</h3> <p>We are going to dig deep with Tensorflow and build a neural network that can distinguish between handwritten numbers. We’ll use the same 5 steps we covered in the high-level overview, and we are going to take time exploring each line of code.</p> <h3>Neural Network: Classify Images</h3> <p>10 minutes. That’s all it takes to build an image classifier thanks to Google! We will provide a high-level overview of how to classify images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Google’s Inception V3 model. Once finished, you will be able to tweak this code to classify any type of image sets!

To do this, we will use a feedforward network as our model and follow input as it moves through the network."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Neural Networks","id":"3896"},{"name":"Computer Science","id":"468204"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Michael Taylor","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781549893643","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781549893643"},"IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1549893645","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"42"},"Label":"Independently published","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"Independently published","NumberOfPages":"167","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"73","Length":"843","Weight":"56","Width":"585"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-10-04","Publisher":"Independently published","Studio":"Independently published","Title":"The Math of Neural Networks"}}}},{"id":"1549893750","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"asin":"1549893750","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Decision-Trees-Random-Forests-Introduction/dp/1549893750?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1549893750","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Decision-Trees-Random-Forests-Introduction/dp/1549893750?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1549893750","salesRank":34605,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51skpOqx5kL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51skpOqx5kL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Decision Trees and Random Forests: A Visual Introduction For Beginners","similar":["1549869132","1549761749","1549893645","1549617214","1973181460","9811110689","0999282905","1491952962","1775093301","152095140X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1549893750&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-11T06%3A32%3A54Z&v=2&sig=GdBiMsr5oA97G5fH3nvWT0CxktvgZLHtNpfW36sCGUQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<h2>If you want to learn how decision trees and random forests work, plus create your own, this visual book is for you.  <br></h2><p><br></p><p>The fact is, decision tree and random forest algorithms are powerful and likely touch your life everyday.</p><p>From online search to product development and credit scoring, both types of algorithms are at work behind the scenes in many modern applications and services.</p><p>They are also used in countless industries such as medicine, manufacturing and finance to help companies make better decisions and reduce risk.</p><p>Whether coded or scratched out by hand, both algorithms are powerful tools that can make a significant impact.</p><p><u><em>This book is a visual introduction for beginners that unpacks the fundamentals of decision trees and random forests.

Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the algorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book, we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming.We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Intelligence & Semantics","id":"280291"},{"name":"Web Design","id":"3525"},{"name":"Mathematics","id":"13884"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":"491300"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Csaba Szepesvari","Binding":"Paperback","Creator":["Ronald Brachman","Thomas Dietterich"],"EAN":"9781608454921","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781608454921"},"Edition":"1","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1608454924","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"750","Weight":"43","Width":"24"},"Label":"Morgan and Claypool Publishers","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"French","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"Morgan and Claypool Publishers","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"104","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"24","Length":"925","Weight":"57","Width":"750"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2010-06-25","Publisher":"Morgan and Claypool Publishers","Studio":"Morgan and Claypool Publishers","Title":"Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning (Synthesis Lectures on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning)"}}}},{"id":"1617293873","data":{"width":64,"height":80,"product":{"asin":"1617293873","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-TensorFlow-Nishant-Shukla/dp/1617293873?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1617293873","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-TensorFlow-Nishant-Shukla/dp/1617293873?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1617293873","salesRank":243679,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41z56prsN7L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"128"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41z56prsN7L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"399"},"title":"Machine Learning with TensorFlow","similar":["1617294438","1491978511","1484230957","1491980451","1491962291","1491914254","1491925612","1787125939","161729554X","0262035618"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1617293873&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-11T06%3A32%3A51Z&v=2&sig=wi6L6RzzIQRD6R%252B4U4uN3MYB9v7LHDSh9foGEGXECIg%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><p><b>Summary</b></p> <p><i>Machine Learning with TensorFlow</i> gives readers a solid foundation in machine-learning concepts plus hands-on experience coding TensorFlow with Python. </p> <p>Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.</p> <p><b>About the Technology</b></p> <p>TensorFlow, Google's library for large-scale machine learning, simplifies often-complex computations by representing them as graphs and efficiently mapping parts of the graphs to machines in a cluster or to the processors of a single machine.</p> <p><b>About the Book</b></p> <p><i>Machine Learning with TensorFlow</i> gives readers a solid foundation in machine-learning concepts plus hands-on experience coding TensorFlow with Python.

I'm sure it was right. But then I designed a learning system for myself that quadrupled my aptitude for learning computer languages. It worked so well for me that I've used it to teach coding to grandmothers, cab drivers, musicians, and 50,000 other newbies.</p><p><i>\"Mark Myers' method of getting what can be...difficult information into a format that makes it exponentially easier to consume, truly understand, and synthesize into real-world application is beyond anything I've encountered before.\" —Amazon reviewer Jason A. Ruby reviewing my first book, A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript</i></p><p><strong>Quadruple your learning ability.</strong></p><p>Washington University research shows that a key teaching method I use—interactive recall practice—improves learning performance 400 percent.</p><p><i>\"I don't feel lost and I don't feel that I am forgetting things as I go along.\" —Amazon reviewer Leonie M. reviewing my second book, A Smarter Way to Learn HTML and CSS</i></p><p><strong>Understanding is easy. Remembering is hard.</strong></p><p>Computer languages are not inherently hard to understand, even for non-techies. <i>Remembering</i> is the problem. If you remember all of Chapter 1 through Chapter 10, you'll understand Chapter 11. But you <em>don't</em> remember. Though you read and read, most of it doesn't stick. You don't have a solid foundation to build on. Halfway through the book, it all collapses. That's when most people give up.</p><p><i>\"I've signed up to a few sites like Udemy, Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, Lynda, YouTube videos, even searched on Coursera but nothing seemed to work for me. This book takes only 10 minutes each chapter and after that, you can exercise what you've just learned right away!\" —Amazon reviewer Constanza Morales reviewing my first book, A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript</i> </p><p><strong>Interactive exercises make it stick.</strong></p><p>Research shows that you will remember everything if you're repeatedly asked to recall it. That's the beauty of flash cards. But technology offers an even better way to make information stick. With my book you get almost a thousand interactive exercises—they're free online—that embed the whole book in your memory. Algorithms check your work to make sure you know what you think you know. When you stumble, you do the exercise again. You keep trying until you know the chapter cold.</p><p><i>\"Not only do the exercises make learning fun, they reinforce the material right away so it sinks in deeper.\" —Amazon reviewer Timothy B. Miller reviewing my second book, A Smarter Way to Learn HTML and CSS</i></p><p><strong>You won't get bored or sleepy.</strong></p><p>The exercises keep you engaged, give you extra practice where you're shaky, and prepare you for each next step. Every lesson is built on top of a solid foundation that you and I have carefully constructed. Each individual step is small. But all the little steps add up to real knowledge—knowledge that you retain.</p><p><i>I finally feel like I KNOW it and won't need to look up the syntax each time...\" —Amazon reviewer J.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. </P><P>The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning.

All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics.

How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies you’ll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in <em>Naked Statistics</em>, the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more. <p>For those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions.</p><p>And in Wheelan’s trademark style, there’s not a dull page in sight. You’ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show <em>Let’s Make a Deal</em>―and you’ll come away with insights each time. With the wit, accessibility, and sheer fun that turned <em>Naked Economics</em> into a bestseller, Wheelan defies the odds yet again by bringing another essential, formerly unglamorous discipline to life.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Statistics","id":"10020691011"},{"name":"Probability & Statistics","id":"13983"},{"name":"Business & Finance","id":"468220"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Charles Wheelan","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"W W Norton Company","EAN":"9780393347777","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780393347777"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"W W Norton Company","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"039334777X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"830","Length":"560","Weight":"44","Width":"80"},"Label":"W.

The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. </P><P><I>Probabilistic Graphical Models</I> discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.</P>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Intelligence & Semantics","id":"280291"},{"name":"Machine Theory","id":"280292"},{"name":"Natural Language Processing","id":"271581011"},{"name":"Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition","id":"132552011"},{"name":"Robotics","id":"3897"},{"name":"Robotics & Automation","id":"13687"},{"name":"Probability & Statistics","id":"13983"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":"491300"},{"name":"Statistics","id":"491548"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Daphne Koller","Nir Friedman"],"Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"imusti","Creator":"Francis Bach","EAN":"9780262013192","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601401113034","9780262013192"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"MIT Press MA","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0262013193","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"800","Weight":"465","Width":"194"},"Label":"The MIT Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"The MIT Press","MPN":"26369268","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"1270","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"197","Length":"906","Weight":"480","Width":"803"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"26369268","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2009-07-31","Publisher":"The MIT Press","Studio":"The MIT Press","Title":"Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)"}}}},{"id":"0071154671","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"asin":"0071154671","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Learning-McGraw-Hill-International-Editions-Computer/dp/0071154671?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0071154671","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Learning-McGraw-Hill-International-Editions-Computer/dp/0071154671?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0071154671","salesRank":54112,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41nTpcpgmiL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41nTpcpgmiL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"332"},"title":"Machine Learning (McGraw-Hill International Editions Computer Science Series)","similar":["1631570897","1491945281","0387310738","0262018020","0262193981","9332543518","0262035618","0596529325","0387848576","0073523402"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0071154671&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-11T06%3A32%3A56Z&v=2&sig=BAN8DhgQcs%252BcCKw3gk68BEvXnA86NvyiUQUaamq39bw%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"This book covers the field of machine learning, which is the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience.

Designers of automated decision support systems must take into account the various sources of uncertainty while balancing the multiple objectives of the system. This book provides an introduction to the challenges of decision making under uncertainty from a computational perspective. It presents both the theory behind decision making models and algorithms and a collection of example applications that range from speech recognition to aircraft collision avoidance.Focusing on two methods for designing decision agents, planning and reinforcement learning, the book covers probabilistic models, introducing Bayesian networks as a graphical model that captures probabilistic relationships between variables; utility theory as a framework for understanding optimal decision making under uncertainty; Markov decision processes as a method for modeling sequential problems; model uncertainty; state uncertainty; and cooperative decision making involving multiple interacting agents. A series of applications shows how the theoretical concepts can be applied to systems for attribute-based person search, speech applications, collision avoidance, and unmanned aircraft persistent surveillance.Decision Making Under Uncertainty unifies research from different communities using consistent notation, and is accessible to students and researchers across engineering disciplines who have some prior exposure to probability theory and calculus. It can be used as a text for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in fields including computer science, aerospace and electrical engineering, and management science. It will also be a valuable professional reference for researchers in a variety of disciplines."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Intelligence & Semantics","id":"280291"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":"491300"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Mykel J.

These models are used in predictive data analytics applications including price prediction, risk assessment, predicting customer behavior, and document classification. This introductory textbook offers a detailed and focused treatment of the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Technical and mathematical material is augmented with explanatory worked examples, and case studies illustrate the application of these models in the broader business context.After discussing the trajectory from data to insight to decision, the book describes four approaches to machine learning: information-based learning, similarity-based learning, probability-based learning, and error-based learning. Each of these approaches is introduced by a nontechnical explanation of the underlying concept, followed by mathematical models and algorithms illustrated by detailed worked examples. Finally, the book considers techniques for evaluating prediction models and offers two case studies that describe specific data analytics projects through each phase of development, from formulating the business problem to implementation of the analytics solution. The book, informed by the authors' many years of teaching machine learning, and working on predictive data analytics projects, is suitable for use by undergraduates in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics; by graduate students in disciplines with applications for predictive data analytics; and as a reference for professionals."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Intelligence & Semantics","id":"280291"},{"name":"Machine Theory","id":"280292"},{"name":"Probability & Statistics","id":"13983"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","id":"491300"},{"name":"Statistics","id":"491548"}],"attributes":{"Author":["John D.

Yet even children recognize that tearing one into small pieces is an act of inconceivable stupidity. What makes a $20 bill actually worth twenty dollars? In the third volume of his best-selling <em>Naked</em> series, Charles Wheelan uses this seemingly simple question to open the door to the surprisingly colorful world of money and banking.</p><p>The search for an answer triggers countless other questions along the way: Why does paper money (“fiat currency” if you want to be fancy) even exist? And why do some nations, like Zimbabwe in the 1990s, print so much of it that it becomes more valuable as toilet paper than as currency? How do central banks use the power of money creation to stop financial crises? Why does most of Europe share a common currency, and why has that arrangement caused so much trouble? And will payment apps, bitcoin, or other new technologies render all of this moot?</p><p>In <em>Naked Money</em>, Wheelan tackles all of the above and more, showing us how our banking and monetary systems should work in ideal situations and revealing the havoc and suffering caused in real situations by inflation, deflation, illiquidity, and other monetary effects. Throughout, Wheelan’s uniquely bright-eyed, whimsical style brings levity and clarity to a subject often devoid of both. With illuminating stories from Argentina, Zimbabwe, North Korea, America, China, and elsewhere around the globe, Wheelan demystifies the curious world behind the paper in our wallets and the digits in our bank accounts.</p> 15 illustrations"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Inflation","id":"2593"},{"name":"Money & Monetary Policy","id":"2598"},{"name":"Banks & Banking","id":"2633"},{"name":"E-Commerce","id":"541256"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Charles Wheelan","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"NORTON","EAN":"9780393353730","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780393353730"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"NORTON","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0393353737","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"830","Length":"550","Weight":"0","Width":"100"},"Label":"W.

Silver's coverage is polymathic, ranging from poker and earthquakes to climate change and terrorism.\"<br> <i>—New York Review of Books</i><br><br> Nate Silver built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance, predicted the 2008 election within a hair’s breadth, and became a national sensation as a blogger—all by the time he was thirty. He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of the website FiveThirtyEight. <br>  <br>Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.<br><br>In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good—or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary—and dangerous—science.<br><br>Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.<br><br>With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver’s insights are an essential read."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Planning & Forecasting","id":"2689"},{"name":"State & Local","id":"14278871"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Probability & Statistics","id":"13983"},{"name":"Technology","id":"14631"},{"name":"Social Sciences","id":"11232"},{"name":"Elections","id":"16023061"},{"name":"Business & Finance","id":"468220"},{"name":"Statistics","id":"491548"},{"name":"Political Science","id":"491464"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Nate Silver","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Penguin Books","EAN":"9780143125082","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780143125082","0884759532674"]},"Edition":"Reprint","Feature":"Penguin Books","ISBN":"0143125087","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"837","Length":"546","Weight":"110","Width":"116"},"Label":"Penguin Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"Penguin Books","MPN":"41360842","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"560","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"134","Length":"827","Weight":"110","Width":"543"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"41360842","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2015-02-03","Publisher":"Penguin Books","ReleaseDate":"2015-02-03","Studio":"Penguin Books","Title":"The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't","UPC":"884759532674","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"884759532674"}}}}},{"id":"0393310728","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"asin":"0393310728","link":"https://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0393310728","url":"https://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0393310728","salesRank":5921,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zFExbOw9L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zFExbOw9L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"How to Lie with Statistics","similar":["039334777X","0143127535","1438009046","0134496493","1565129768","0062731025","0205004067","1593276206","0809058405","0807072133"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0393310728&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-11T06%3A32%3A58Z&v=2&sig=QG6hwP%252FyXLk54NtUHan%252FT2HeeqegS4B9iJUlDbSpKpI%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><strong>Over Half a Million Copies Sold--an Honest-to-Goodness Bestseller</strong></p> Darrell Huff runs the gamut of every popularly used type of statistic, probes such things as the sample study, the tabulation method, the interview technique, or the way the results are derived from the figures, and points up the countless number of dodges which are used to full rather than to inform."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"\"There is terror in numbers,\" writes Darrell Huff in <I>How to Lie with Statistics</I>. And nowhere does this terror translate to blind acceptance of authority more than in the slippery world of averages, correlations, graphs, and trends. Huff sought to break through \"the daze that follows the collision of statistics with the human mind\" with this slim volume, first published in 1954. The book remains relevant as a wake-up call for people unaccustomed to examining the endless flow of numbers pouring from Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and everywhere else someone has an axe to grind, a point to prove, or a product to sell. \"The secret language of statistics, so appealing in a fact-minded culture, is employed to sensationalize, inflate, confuse, and oversimplify,\" warns Huff.<p> Although many of the examples used in the book are charmingly dated, the cautions are timeless. Statistics are rife with opportunities for misuse, from \"gee-whiz graphs\" that add nonexistent drama to trends, to \"results\" detached from their method and meaning, to statistics' ultimate bugaboo--faulty cause-and-effect reasoning. Huff's tone is tolerant and amused, but no-nonsense. Like a lecturing father, he expects you to learn something useful from the book, and start applying it every day. Never be a sucker again, he cries!<p> <blockquote>Even if you can't find a source of demonstrable bias, allow yourself some degree of skepticism about the results as long as there is a possibility of bias somewhere. There always is.</blockquote><p> Read <I>How to Lie with Statistics</I>. Whether you encounter statistics at work, at school, or in advertising, you'll remember its simple lessons. Don't be terrorized by numbers, Huff implores. \"The fact is that, despite its mathematical base, statistics is as much an art as it is a science.\" <I>--Therese Littleton</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economics","id":"2581"},{"name":"Statistics","id":"10020691011"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Probability & Statistics","id":"13983"},{"name":"Politics & Social Sciences","id":"3377866011"},{"name":"Business & Finance","id":"468220"},{"name":"Social Sciences","id":"468214"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Darrell Huff","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"W W Norton Company","Creator":"Irving Geis","EAN":"9780393310726","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780393310726","8580001043968","8601417124642","0352091242112"]},"Edition":"Reissue","Feature":"W W Norton Company","ISBN":"0393310728","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"830","Length":"550","Weight":"45","Width":"50"},"Label":"W.

This is important in a rapidly evolving risk management and financial world. Analysts with a strong statistical background understand that a large data set can represent a treasure trove of information to be mined and can yield a strong competitive advantage. This book provides budding actuaries and financial analysts with a foundation in multiple regression and time series. Readers will learn about these statistical techniques using data on the demand for insurance, lottery sales, foreign exchange rates, and other applications. Although no specific knowledge of risk management or finance is presumed, the approach introduces applications in which statistical techniques can be used to analyze real data of interest. In addition to the fundamentals, this book describes several advanced statistical topics that are particularly relevant to actuarial and financial practice, including the analysis of longitudinal, two-part (frequency/severity), and fat-tailed data.
