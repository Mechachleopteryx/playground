<h5>Personal Opinion</h5>

    <a class='accent' href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Rental-Property-Investing-Intelligent/dp/099071179X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=099071179X">The Book on Rental Property Investing</a>
    is my first book on retnal property invetment. While I'm not actively looking to become
    an investor, the book gave me a lot of "behind the scene" knowledge. The BiggerPockets community
    was one of the biggest discoveries from this book.
