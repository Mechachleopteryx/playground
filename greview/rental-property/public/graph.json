Author Loftis, who has purchased liens on properties owned by famous athletes like NBA stars and world champion boxers, national banks (like <i>Chase Manhattan Bank </i>and <i>LaSalle National Bank)</i>, and even a building whose major tenant was the local sheriff's department, reveals that he has seen liens on properties owned by a 9-time Wimbledon champion, a 3-time Masters champion, a Cy Young and World Series winner, a movie icon, an international celebrity athlete/model, and even properties owned by cities, the U.S. Post Office, and even the U.S. government!<br><br>In this authoritative guide, Loftis helps investors avoid the pitfalls while answering all the key questions they need to consider: <br><br>* What states are lien states and what states are deed states, and how do they work?<br>* What about the \"hybrid\" (as Loftis calls them) states like Texas and Georgia?<br>* How does an investor go about bidding at tax sales? And what is the due diligence required?<br>* What are the different requirements in each state? <br>* Where are the risks in this type of investing, and how do I avoid them? <br>* How long do I have to wait to get paid off, and what rate of return can I expect?<br>* How are counties selling liens and deeds using internet auctions, and how do I start?"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economics","id":"2581"},{"name":"Introduction","id":"2670"},{"name":"Investments","id":"2653"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Larry Loftis","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Loftis, Larry B.","EAN":"9781427795953","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781427795953"},"Edition":"Second","ISBN":"1427795959","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"725","Weight":"86","Width":"80"},"Label":"Kaplan Publishing","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2200","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$22.00"},"Manufacturer":"Kaplan Publishing","MPN":"9781427795953","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"225","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"120","Length":"890","Weight":"85","Width":"730"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9781427795953","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2007-11-06","Publisher":"Kaplan Publishing","ReleaseDate":"2007-11-06","Studio":"Kaplan Publishing","Title":"Profit by Investing in Real Estate Tax Liens: Earn Safe, Secured, and Fixed Returns Every Time"}}}},{"id":"1438007450","data":{"width":61.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1495,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.95"},"asin":"1438007450","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Barrons-Real-Estate-Licensing-Exams/dp/1438007450?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1438007450","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Barrons-Real-Estate-Licensing-Exams/dp/1438007450?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1438007450","salesRank":11693,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51AZukKlwUL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"123"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51AZukKlwUL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"384"},"title":"Barron's Real Estate Licensing Exams, 10th Edition (Barron's Real Estate Licensing Exams: Salesperson, Broker, Appraiser)","similar":["0764167715","1438008767","1119370655","0915777118","099880519X","1518671594","0307453723","1423216660","0071444041","0692839666"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1438007450&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A39Z&v=2&sig=BiCLDuXuHZJLww9xk05nPeFe9j1MOmv0z99KHxhrYt0%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"This study guide and test preparation manual has been updated to provide the latest information in real estate finance, federal law and regulation, and appraisal license requirements.<ul><LI>Explains all aspects of real estate law and finance, including contracts, deeds, appraisals, brokerage, leasing, mortgages, federal regulation of Fair Housing, Truth-in-Lending, and environmental matters<LI>Presents more than 1,600 practice questions similar to those found on licensing exams, including 9 model tests<LI>All questions answered and explained</ul><BR>The authors, who are experienced brokers and teachers, have included an extensive glossary of real estate terms that include practical examples."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Real Estate","id":"2650"},{"name":"Vocational Tests","id":"11666"},{"name":"Professional","id":"11695"},{"name":"Test Prep & Study Guides","id":"684300011"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Jack P.

Mainly because \"they don't know what they don't know.<br> I’ve spent over 30 years helping investors buy and sell over 9 million square feet of property and witnessed the practices of professional and small investors. It wasn’t until I became an acquisition executive and learned some humiliating, expensive lessons that “I didn’t know what I didn’t know”.<br> You will learn how to avoid mistakes with costly consequences, create more value, and more essential information for buying investment property.</b><br> This book is a #1 Best Seller of commercial real estate books on Amazon. It is an easy-to-follow, proven \"step by step\" system that investors and real estate professionals use regularly while conducting their due diligence. It will help you to make informed, intelligent decisions when deciding whether to buy or NOT buy.<br> <b>Adhering to a proven system allows you to conduct due diligence faster, easier, more efficiently and you’re less likely to miss something.</b><br> <br> <b>Here are just a few of the lessons you’ll learn:</b> <ul> <li><b>Negotiating the purchase and sale agreement</b> and what you MUST include in order to maximize your opportunities to negotiate further with the seller. (Super important to know.)</li> <li><b>Reviewing the leases</b> Not knowing what provisions to watch for could cost you dearly once you own it. (Don't leave it up to chance to \"work out.\")</li> <li><b>Uncovering hidden problems and issues</b> (Sellers will NOT disclose these, so you need to know where to look for them. They will not \"hand you a list of problems\" about the property. Many of these issues could make or break your investment.)</li> <li><b>Critical factors to consider during your financial analysis</b>. There's a list of essential questions included that MUST be addressed. (Leaving these questions unanswered can be potentially devastating to an investment.)</li> <li><b>Not \"over-paying\"</b> by making sure you’re getting all you deserve, by getting credited fairly for items on the closing statement. (This includes specific items to review, instructions on what to ask for to minimize your chances of getting taken advantage of, potentially losing big money by not having this information.)</li> </ul> <br>These fundamentals remain the same and are all applicable whether they are: residential rental properties, industrial, retail, or office buildings. <b>This system will help reduce risk and create value for all of them.</b><br> <b>In addition, the handbook includes:</b> <ul> <li><b>PHYSICAL & MECHANICAL INSPECTION PHOTOS</b> (That shows you what to look for and how to assess issues.)</li> <li><b>Due Diligence Checklist</b></li> <li><b>Due Diligence Document Checklist</b></li> <li><b>Sample Tenant Questionnaire </b> (A sample list of questions that you should ask of tenants when conducting a tenant interview. This is a wealth of information when done properly. Learn this or lose out.)</li> </ul> <br>By having this valuable system, you will be more prepared and confident in your ability to negotiate, going up against ANY seller.<br> <br> As a pilot uses a pre-flight checklist prior to each flight, you'll want to refer to this handbook every time you buy an investment property. <b>There are too many things to remember. We need reminding as much as we need learning! Warren Buffet said, \"Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.\" So having a proven system in place helps you know what you're doing.

The book covers everything you need to know about the home buying and selling process so that you are not taken advantage of. including: - Deciding on how much money to spend on a house(don't let your lender or agent decide for you!) - Deciding whether you should buy or rent - How to get a great deal on a house that will build instant equity - How to get the best loan with less money down (if that is your goal) and the lower overall cost - How to find the best real estate agent and lender and why you need them - How the process works including inspections, appraisals, title insurance, mortgages, closings, escrows, HOAs, etc... - How to fix up your house and maintain it - How to find contractors to help you fix up your house - How to sell your house for the most money - When and if you should refinance your house - A glossary full of definitions for real estate terms - Plus bonus chapters on starting a career in real estate There has been a lot of talk about real estate being a bad investment. Many financial and economic advisers suggest buying a home may be worse for your finances than renting. However, I think most people do not take the home buying or selling process seriously. They put all their faith in other people to get the right deal done for them. If you blindly buy a house based on what your real estate agent or lender tell you, it may not be a good investment! However, if you are able to find great deals, get a good loan, and take care of your home, real estate can be an incredible tool to build wealth. I am a real estate agent, and real estate investor who has done very well buying hundreds of houses. I try to teach what I know to others to help them make smarter and better decisions. If you know the right way to buy a home, it beats renting every time. There is a lot of information in this book, and depending on your real estate experience you may know some of it, or be familiar with a lot of it. I have created four sections with many chapters to make it easy to navigate. The first part of the book focuses on the bare basics of buying and selling houses, while the later sections go deeper into each aspect of real estate. I hope you enjoy the book and learn how to make your real estate purchases awesome investments."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Buying & Selling Homes","id":"2651"},{"name":"Business & Finance","id":"468220"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Mark Ferguson","Binding":"Paperback","Creator":"Gregory Helmerick","EAN":"9781521055656","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781521055656"},"IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1521055653","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"72"},"Label":"Independently published","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1195","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$11.95"},"Manufacturer":"Independently published","NumberOfPages":"318","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"71","Length":"890","Weight":"115","Width":"598"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-05-10","Publisher":"Independently published","Studio":"Independently published","Title":"How to Buy a House: What Everyone Should Know Before They Buy or Sell a Home"}}}},{"id":"1523269030","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":999,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$9.99"},"asin":"1523269030","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Real-Estate-Investing-Gone-Bad/dp/1523269030?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1523269030","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Real-Estate-Investing-Gone-Bad/dp/1523269030?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1523269030","salesRank":84318,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aWiYoLZDL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aWiYoLZDL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Real Estate Investing Gone Bad: 21 true stories of what NOT to do when investing in real estate and flipping houses","similar":["1475235216","099071179X","0988973707","1483590542","0990711714","0988973715","0071486100","1530663946","0740718584","0990711757"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1523269030&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A32Z&v=2&sig=PHHwpZuy0IiyizOzTNO5TGWA%252FSh4T5Z0y51TyJRLbGQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Discover 21 true stories of real estate investing deals that went terribly wrong and the lessons you can learn from them.

I had a degree in business finance, I was smart, and I knew I would be successful. The only problem I had, was I had no plan, no idea what I wanted to do for work, and I wasn’t the hardest worker. For some reason, I was not super successful right out of college! I ended up working for my dad part-time in real estate, which became full-time and then an awesome business. I struggled in the beginning of my career, not because I was in the wrong field, or I was not knowledgeable, but because I had a bad attitude and did not know how to be successful. <br><br> I thought I was smart, I was educated, I thought I could be successful, but there is much more to success than intelligence and education. Hard work is also a very important part of success, and although I could have definitely worked a little harder in school and at work, that wasn’t the missing piece to the puzzle. Not only did I struggle after college, I became very frustrated with where my career was going. I lost some of my dreams, I started to tell myself I didn’t want fancy things or nice cars, because I started to believe I would never be able to get those things. If I convinced myself, I didn’t want those things, maybe I would be less disappointed. <br><br> A funny thing happened a few years into my real estate career. I got fed up with how things were going and I made some drastic changes. At first the changes resulted in me making much less money and being way more stressed! However, I accidentally started to create some goals, because I got fed up with how things were going. Then I started to listen to other people and not rely on just myself. I got outside my comfort zone and did things that scared me and were very hard to do. My life started to turn around, and success followed very quickly. I went from having a goal to make $100,000 a year to a goal to make $1,000,000 a year in a few years. I found success in multiple businesses. I built a team that reduced my stress and time I worked. I became happier, I bought an awesome house, had an awesome family and even bought a Lamborghini (a life-long dream). The more successful I became, the more I realized that success was not about intelligence, hard work or even education. It was about belief, planning, confidence and structure. <br><br> In this book I will tell you a little more about my story. How I made $28,000 in 2006, but now have 16 rentals, flip 10 to 15 houses a year, run a real estate team of ten and work less than 40 hours a week. I could retire at the age of 37, but I have big goals and big aspirations, plus I love what I do!"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Personal Finance","id":"2717"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Mark Ferguson","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781535004473","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781535004473"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"1535004479","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"46"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1099","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$10.99"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","NumberOfPages":"200","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"46","Length":"900","Weight":"80","Width":"600"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-06-29","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"How to Change Your Mindset to Achieve Huge Success: Why your attitude and daily habits have more to do with making more money and having more freedom than anything else."}}}},{"id":"1540577317","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1495,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.95"},"asin":"1540577317","link":"https://www.amazon.com/53-Strategies-get-more-Listings/dp/1540577317?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1540577317","url":"https://www.amazon.com/53-Strategies-get-more-Listings/dp/1540577317?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1540577317","salesRank":364039,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417aaQji64L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417aaQji64L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"53 Strategies to get more Listings: Real Estate Agents that REALLY work","similar":["0998354503","1945507357","1521243573","1523610840","0307453723","1544986157","0989587223","194258900X","153366160X","1544500416"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1540577317&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A40Z&v=2&sig=aomuS%252BIRtpGc4qkREV4FH4%252FF%252FpqtV9LqzQeAPs10kRA%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"My name is Jason Morris.

He had been active in his community, he volunteered at church, he coached soccer, and worked hard to build his practice for 25+ years. He developed a great reputation, patients loved him, and his practice was booming. He was so busy that he didn’t have a lot of time to spend on retirement planning and just assumed it would all work out. </p> <p>No one ever told him about Professional’s White Coat Syndrome. He didn’t see the black clouds gathering on the horizon. He trusted his advisors. He didn’t know government overreach was about to steal his autonomy and ruin the profession he loved. He never thought about needing a backup plan. He was too focused on treating patients to see the handwriting on the wall. </p> <p>This is his story. Learn from his mistakes, develop your own action plan, and profit from his discovery of the perfect investment to help you create tax free multi-generational wealth and a worry-free retirement! </p> <p>“DONE! is a must read that will take you on a journey through the world of multifamily real estate investing. This book is easy to read, concise, and to the point.”<b>- Dr. Eric Kaplan, DC President’s Advisory Council, personal physician to the president, and two-time national best selling author.</b></p> <p>“Dr. Robbins explains in simple terms how an asset class once accessible only to the wealthy can be a tool for all. The days of sufficient income produced by CD’s and single company dividends are over. Disciplined multifamily investing, alongside competent partners who themselves have much to lose, is the surest way to a more secure financial future.”<b>- Michael J. Mandl President & CEO Mandl & Co., LLC, Former Executive Vice President Emory University and President & CEO Emory Healthcare.</b></p> <p>“DONE! should be a prerequisite to any medical professional before starting school. I wish I had read it earlier in my training. However, it can be applied to all healthcare professions at any stage in their career.” <b>- Dr. Adam Dailey, MD, Anesthesiologist</b></p> <p>“DONE! takes a heartfelt and honest look at one medical professional’s quest for passive income. After many dead ends, the author makes the case for commercial multifamily investing. This is a great read for any high income professional looking to secure passive income.\"<b>- David Draghinas, MD </b></p> <p>“For those of us who don’t have time to become savvy investors because all our time is spent attending to our careers and our families, Brian has done the heavy lifting. Not only can this book save you countless hours of potentially boring research, but because he is open about his own mistakes, it could save you from crippling losses.”<b>- Stuart Graydon Jr., Co-founder and Chairman of Investortools, Inc., a privately held firm that specializes in portfolio management and credit analysis systems for institutional investors</b></p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Investments","id":"2653"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Dr Brian Robbins","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781544030814","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781544030814"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"1544030819","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"550","Width":"68"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$15.00"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","MPN":"43239-4762","NumberOfPages":"272","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"68","Length":"850","Weight":"92","Width":"550"},"PartNumber":"43239-4762","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-03-13","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"Done!: The Professional's Guide to Double-Digit Returns, Multi-Generational Wealth, and a Worry-Free Retirement"}}}},{"id":"1544500416","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2499,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$24.99"},"asin":"1544500416","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Model-Marketing-Strategies-Transform/dp/1544500416?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1544500416","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Model-Marketing-Strategies-Transform/dp/1544500416?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1544500416","salesRank":130965,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pYJ4PhdvL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pYJ4PhdvL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"324"},"title":"Mindset, Model and Marketing!: The Proven Strategies to Transform and Grow Your Real Estate Business","similar":["1945507357","1544986157","1523610840","0998354503","0345520645","194258900X","1119211883","1942952473","0071444041","0692905669"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1544500416&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A39Z&v=2&sig=WBLlT6uNxpW604RWP0YXgiyMTgoMb1SRi%252Fly6scZeqQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Real estate is a tricky business.

Literature.\" It was the first book to boldly ask, \"What makes a winner?\" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself. <p>The most famous of all teachers of success spent \"a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort\" to produce the \"Law of Success\" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.</p> <p>In the original <strong>Think and Grow Rich</strong>, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Motivational","id":"4744"},{"name":"Personal Transformation","id":"4745"},{"name":"Success","id":"4749"},{"name":"Budgeting & Money Management","id":"2719"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Napoleon Hill","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Unknown","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"XM-1585424331"},"Creator":"Arthur R.

In this seminal book, Sigmund Freud enumerates the fundamental tensions between civilization and the individual. The primary friction stems from the individual's quest for instinctual freedom and civilization's contrary demand for conformity and instinctual repression. Many of humankind's primitive instincts (for example, the desire to kill and the insatiable craving for sexual gratification) are clearly harmful to the well-being of a human community. As a result, civilization creates laws that prohibit killing, rape, and adultery, and it implements severe punishments if such commandments are broken. This process, argues Freud, is an inherent quality of civilization that instills perpetual feelings of discontent in its citizens."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Psychoanalysis","id":"11199"},{"name":"Social Psychology & Interactions","id":"11223"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Sigmund Freud","Binding":"Paperback","Creator":"Joan Riviere","EAN":"9781614279846","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781614279846"},"ISBN":"1614279845","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"921","Length":"614","Weight":"27","Width":"19"},"Label":"Martino Fine Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"950","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$9.50"},"Manufacturer":"Martino Fine Books","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"74","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"50","Length":"950","Weight":"20","Width":"630"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-07-01","Publisher":"Martino Fine Books","ReleaseDate":"2016-07-01","Studio":"Martino Fine Books","Title":"Civilization and Its Discontents"}}}},{"id":"1619274094","data":{"width":60,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2395,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$23.95"},"asin":"1619274094","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Invest-Debt-Jimmy-Napier/dp/1619274094?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1619274094","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Invest-Debt-Jimmy-Napier/dp/1619274094?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1619274094","salesRank":319730,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41pPW4A5%2BvL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"120"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41pPW4A5%2BvL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"376"},"title":"Invest in Debt","similar":["1546664319","154129601X","0997584777","1496173589","1510715193","1495171930","0982704518","0936783397","1259643883","1976863910"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1619274094&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A35Z&v=2&sig=tKtozcGjUCWUl28ar9t57kLSDE5jIQMNtPvpKPYBH%252F0%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Newly updated version of the classic book from Jimmy Napier."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Subjects","id":"1000"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jimmy Napier","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781619274099","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781619274099"},"ISBN":"1619274094","ItemDimensions":{"Weight":"100"},"NumberOfPages":"130","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"60","Length":"910","Weight":"100","Width":"600"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"BOOKS_1973_AND_LATER","PublicationDate":"2013","Title":"Invest in Debt"}}}},{"id":"1626342849","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2205,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$22.05"},"asin":"1626342849","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Selling-Subtle-Skills-Results/dp/1626342849?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1626342849","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Selling-Subtle-Skills-Results/dp/1626342849?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1626342849","salesRank":14884,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41JdzkB%2BVBL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41JdzkB%2BVBL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Ninja Selling: Subtle Skills.

In the<br />past 75 years, the U.S. tax law has only seen three major revisions; one in 1954,<br />the next in 1986 and most recently at the end of 2017. I have been fortunate as<br />a tax professional to be heavily involved in the last two reforms.<br />In 1986, I was a manager in the National Tax Department (NTD) of<br />Ernst & Whinney (now Ernst Young). My primary responsibility during my<br />three years there was to create, teach and administer tax courses to the Firm’s<br />U.S. tax professionals. Just as I arrived in the summer of 1985, I discovered<br />that much of NTD’s resources were being devoted to following the tax reform<br />bill that had been introduced that year.<br />This gave me, as a young tax professional, some amazing insight into the<br />legislative process as well as the horse trading for tax reform. President Reagan<br />wanted two things; simplicity (the 1985 act was call the Tax Simplification<br />Act of 1985) and he wanted it to be revenue neutral (no net increase to the<br />deficit). It took another year before bill was finally passed as the Tax Reform<br />Act of 1986. (Simplicity took a back seat to other goals of the reform.)<br />In 1986 the big winners from tax reform were individuals, with significantly<br />lower tax rates, insurance companies (who got by relatively unscathed)<br />and businesses. The big loser was real estate investors (the passive loss rules<br />were used as a last-ditch effort to make a “revenue-neutral” bill. The result a<br />few years later was the Savings and Loan debacle accompanied by a massive<br />real estate depression and the government bailing out real estate through<br />the RTC (Resolution Trust Corporation).<br />Fast forward 31 years to 2017. President Trump had promised economic<br />stimulus and had stumbled out of the blocks with the failure to repeal<br />ObamaCare. Everyone thought tax reform would take two years to complete<br />like it had in 1985-1986. Instead, the Republican-controlled Congress was<br />able to use slick procedural rules to pass major tax reform in record time (less<br />than three months from start to finish).<br />The result was a bill the consequences of which and application of which<br />are still largely unknown. Known are the clear winners and losers. Losers<br />include employees with lost deductions for moving, investment expenses<br />and reductions in home mortgage interest and state income tax deductions.<br />Winners include big corporations, with a major tax reduction from 35% to<br />big corporations, with a major tax reduction from 35% to<br />21%, small businesses, with a 20% net income deduction, and real estate, with<br />major depreciation incentives and the 20% net income deduction given to<br />other small businesses.<br />The key to remember is that very few people had the chance to influence<br />this legislation. Everyone has the same chance to take advantage of the windfalls<br />given to the winners. Employees can choose to be independent contractors<br />and receive the 20% small business deduction. Service professionals who were<br />left out of the 20% deduction can now become C corporations and reduce<br />their tax rate to 21%. Investors who received tax benefits from the costs of<br />investing in the stock market can either begin investing in real estate, with its<br />massive tax benefits, or invest through their Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) and<br />avoid tax altogether on the income and gains from their investments.<br />Tax-Free Wealth is about using the tax law the way it’s meant to be used<br />– as a series of incentives to do what the government wants you to do. This<br />Second Edition incorporates some ideas of how to use the new incentives. The<br />reality is that the incentives don’t really change that much. The government<br />still wants businesses to hire employees, so businesses receive tax benefits<br />for doing so. The government still wants investors to provide housing for<br />renters (even more so now), so real estate investors receive large tax breaks for<br />following through on the government’s goals. Energy is still favored, both<br />traditional energy (oil & gas and coal) and renewable energy (wind, solar and<br />hydroelectric).<br />For U.S. taxpayers, you will find helpful tips in this new edition to help<br />you apply the new tax incentives to your situation. As a bonus, I have included<br />information and a link to a free eBook that you can download detailing the<br />Top Ten Tax Benefits from the Trump Tax Reform. For you who live outside<br />the United States, and no matter what country you live in, this edition should<br />help you look for ways to apply your government’s incentives. You may even<br />decide that now is the time to do business in the United States as that country.<br />is, to some degree, a tax haven.<br />You can take advantage of the tax incentives offered by your government<br />only if you understand how the tax law works. Every day, you have the<br />opportunity to reduce your taxes. Once you have digested this book, take it<br />to your tax advisor and have them read it (or better yet, buy them their own<br />copy). Then your tax advisor, who is responsible for understanding all of the<br />technical details of the law, can help you apply them to your specific situation.<br />Enjoy this book and let me know what you think.

Fewer than 10% of agents will make over $100,000 and the majority that do have been in the business for decades. The average real estate agent sells 12 homes a year, and for agents who are just starting out that number is less than four. <p> In 2012 Dan Lesniak used a unique strategy to upend these industry trends. In his first year in real estate Dan completed over 36 transactions to total over $22 million in sold volume, making him one of the most successful rookie real estate agents ever. This then set him up to take over one of the most competitive market areas in the country – one completely dominated by agents with 10+ years' experience. <p> With The HyperLocal HyperFast Real Estate Agent, Dan tells how he used the Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning (STP) framework to identify potential markets, choose which ones to go after and how to add massive value to the consumers in that market. This book will teach you how to use the STP framework to enter new markets or increase market share in your existing markets by adding more value to your potential clients and communicating your value proposition to the market. Whether you are a new agent getting started or a veteran looking for more growth this book will show you how to do it using examples of how Dan did it in the hyper competitive Arlington, VA (Greater Washington DC) market. <p>What Other Industry Leaders Have Said About the Book: <br> “I have been coaching realtors for 22 years. Dan is the best business man who sells real estate that I’ve ever seen. He has great systems, structures, and processes. That is what separates him from the rest!” - Rick Ruby, Core Head Coach <p>\"One of my favorite sayings is 'follow the yellow brick road'. In this book, Dan clearly lays out the path to Emerald City, avoiding all the dangers of creating your own way. In Dan's first year, he closed over $22 million in sales, a feat matched by only the tiniest fraction of real estate agents—regardless of experience. If you are looking for a step-by-step plan from someone who has done it, this is the book for you!\" - Pam O’Bryant, Chief Engagement Officer for Keller Williams Capital Properties, Contributor to Gary Keller’s The Millionaire Real Estate Agent book <p>\"There is no greater opportunity right now in the real estate industry than there is in the expansion market. This will require you to grow in your existing market and know how to expand in new ones. This book is a great example of how to rapidly expand in any market and is a must read for expansion team leaders.\" -Noah Ostroff, Chief Executive Officer of Global Living and Top Selling Keller Williams Agent <p>\"Dan Lesniak is the real deal. He runs the most profitable real estate team I know of, hands down. If you want to compress time to achieve your goals, listen to this guy and take action now!\" - Jeff Latham, President of Latham Realty Unlimited with 275 homes sold annually <p>\"Dan and I first met when he was just getting started in the business, and I have been blown away at how he was able to grow his brand so rapidly in a very competitive market. Dan’s creative approach and tenacity has served him well, and he is a great example of how to commit and succeed as a young real estate agent.\" - Thad Wise, Senior Vice President with First Savings Mortgage Corporation and $100 Million Loan Officer <p>\"Dan Lesniak is by far one of the brightest and highest-skilled real estate agents I have had the pleasure of working with; his strategies for his clients are brilliant! Dan has succeeded in one of the most competitive markets in the country, while also growing his brokerage and giving back to the community.\" - Elysia Stobbe, Real Estate RockStar and #1 Best Selling author of How To Get Approved for the Best Mortgage Without Sticking a Fork in Your Eye"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Buying & Selling Homes","id":"2651"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Daniel James Lesniak","Binding":"Paperback","Creator":"Keri Shull","EAN":"9780998354507","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780998354507"},"ISBN":"0998354503","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"55"},"Label":"DKB Publishing","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$14.99"},"Manufacturer":"DKB Publishing","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"242","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"4","Length":"902","Weight":"80","Width":"598"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-02-23","Publisher":"DKB Publishing","Studio":"DKB Publishing","Title":"The HyperLocal HyperFast Real Estate Agent: How to Dominate Your Real Estate Market in Under a Year, I Did it and so Can You!"}}}},{"id":"141332505X","data":{"width":61.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2475,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$24.75"},"asin":"141332505X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Tenants-Legal-Portman-Attorney/dp/141332505X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=141332505X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Tenants-Legal-Portman-Attorney/dp/141332505X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=141332505X","salesRank":500770,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516XaX8BRUL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"123"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516XaX8BRUL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"385"},"title":"Every Tenant's Legal Guide","similar":["1413325173","1413324827","1413324908","1413323081","198210970X","1413325114"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=141332505X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A33Z&v=2&sig=8lij4ya2pSjfZnN21pEwl06JXbtMyBC5YFSWr9WUXjg%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>Renters have many legal rights―learn yours and how to protect them!</b> <br><br> The only book of its kind, <i>Every Tenant's Legal Guide</i> gives you the legal and practical information you need (plus dozens of sample letters and forms) to find and keep a great home and landlord.

Since then, I have studied religions, prayer, meditation, yoga, affirmation, visualization, and NLP (neuro-linguistic programming). I've walked on fire, and explored other \"unconventional\" philosophies, some \"too far out there\" to mention.</p> <p> </p> <p>\"What Hal has done with his acronym SAVERS is taken the \"best practices\"--developed over centuries of human consciousness development--and condensed the \"best of the best\" into a daily morning ritual. A ritual that is now part of my day.</p> <p> </p> <p>\"Many people do one of the SAVERS daily. For example, many people do the E, the exercise every morning. Others do S for silence or meditation, or S for scribing, journaling every morning. But until Hal packaged SAVERS, no one was doing all six ancient 'best practices' every morning.</p> <p> </p> <p>\"Miracle Morning is perfect for very busy, successful people. Going through SAVERS every morning is like pumping rocket fuel into my body, mind, and spirit... before I start my day, every day.</p> <p> </p> <p>\"As my rich dad often said, \"I can always make another dollar, but I cannot make another day.\" If you want to maximize every day of your life, read Miracle Morning.\"</p> <p>========================================</p> <p>What if you could miraculously wake up tomorrow and any--or every area of your life was transformed?

I told people I was doing well when I was often on the edge of being broke. <br><br>Millions of people face the same plight--including my beloved brother-in-law, who died tragically before he could fix his money problems. That was MY wake-up call. I knew I needed more money, but I didn't know how to get it.

Now I'm going to show you how to do the same. <br><br>In polite society, we don't like to talk about money. But it's too important to tiptoe around.

You know how it goes; it sounds a lil something like this:</p> <p> <em>\"Go to school, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to the stock market, and one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich.\"</em> </p> <p> The mainstream financial gurus have sold you blindly down the river to a great financial gamble: You've been hoodwinked to believe that wealth can be created by recklessly trusting in the <strong>uncontrollable</strong> and <strong>unpredictable</strong> markets: the <b>housing market</b>, the <b>stock market</b>, and the <b>job market</b>. This impotent financial gamble dubiously promises <em><strong>wealth in a wheelchair</strong></em> -- sacrifice your adult life for a financial plan that reaps dividends in the twilight of life. Accept the Slowlane as your blueprint for wealth and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of <b>HOPE:</b> <b>HOPE</b> you can find a job and keep it, <b>HOPE</b> the stock market doesn't tank, <b>HOPE</b> the economy rebounds, HOPE, HOPE, and HOPE. Do you really want <b>HOPE</b> to be the centerpiece for your family's financial plan? </p> <p> Drive the Slowlane road and you will find your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about <em>what you cannot do</em>, versus <em>what you can</em>. For those who don't want a lifetime subscription to \"settle-for-less\" and a slight chance of elderly riches, there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth that can burn a trail to financial independence faster than any road out there. <ul> <li>Why jobs, 401(k)s, mutual funds, and 40-years of mindless frugality will never make you rich young.</li> <li>Why most entrepreneurs fail and how to immediately put the odds in your favor. </li> <li>The real law of wealth: Leverage this and wealth has no choice but to be magnetized to you.</li> <li>The leading cause of poorness: Change this and you change everything.</li> <li>How the rich really get rich - and no, it has nothing to do with a paycheck or a 401K match.</li> <li>Why the guru's grand deity - compound interest - is an impotent wealth accelerator.</li> <li>Why the guru myth of \"do what you love\" will most likely keep you poor, not rich.</li> <li>And 250+ more poverty busting distinctions... </li> </ul> <p> Demand the Fastlane, an alternative road-to-wealth; one that actually ignites dreams and creates millionaires young, not old. Change lanes and find your explosive wealth accelerator.

That's the way most investors approach their investment property management plan. </span><br /><br /><span>Without a strategy for increasing value with your property's management plan is just taking the \"lottery\" approach. </span><br /><br /><span>You want the \"Cliff Notes\" version. In other words, the 20% that will give you 80% of the results, and not a bunch of minutia with 30 to 50 pages of fluff that you have to sift through to find the helpful tips or key points. If you've read my book, \"The Due Diligence Handbook For Commercial Real Estate\" you know what I'm talking about. I attribute its popularity to the fact that it cuts through to the \"meat\" of the subject and gives the reader the step-by-step instructional information needed to conduct due diligence properly when buying investment properties. This is an extremely important part of the process that can make or break investment decisions. Your \"golden\" opportunity may turn to \"lead\" if you don't know where to find the hidden problems, undiscovered issues, and value creation opportunities an investment may hold. Much money can be saved and made by learning how to do it properly. Unfortunately, most investors and real estate professionals don't know how to properly conduct due diligence because they \"don't know what they don't know.\" </span><br /><br /><span>The fundamentals remain the same for the most part, when it comes to adding value and leasing. This information can be used across the various genres of commercial real estate investments, whether it's office and industrial, retail or multi-family residential properties. I comment from time to time throughout the book on the different angles or strategies you may want to consider for the different property types, which I have obtained from my own background and experience of 30+ years in the commercial real estate industry--or from those I know to be the best at their particular specialty.</span><br /><br /><span>In this handbook you will learn:</span><br /><span>*How to determine the best way to price the rental rate for your investment property to get it leased at the highest value </span><br /><span>*Find ways to make your property attractive to tenants</span><br /><span>*How to interview and choose the right people that will help you get your property leased</span><br /><span>*How to structure your lease rate and terms to create the most value for your investment property</span><br /><span>*How to incentivize tenants to get your property leased in a down or over crowded market</span><br /><span>*Strategies and tips to create more value</span><br /><span>* Essential analysis forms, proposal and lease form samples, tenant application and other forms</span><br /><br /><span>These are very learnable skills that can be put into use right away to enhance your efforts to add value to your real estate investment.</span><br /><br /><span>For the more seasoned commercial real estate investors and professionals, I will share valuable experience from my time as a landlord representative where I leased properties as a local leasing broker. I also spent time as a Vice President of Leasing for an investor who owned about 12 million square feet across the U.S, where I had to learn local practices and customs, as well as the ins and outs of the various markets such as Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Orlando and Phoenix. Experiences learned during this phase of my career have also contributed to the contents of this book.</span><br /><br /><span>By learning and implementing these essential value-enhancing principles you can easily increase your property's cash flow exponentially. Every day you wait is another day of flushing more money down the drain. Buy it today and start generating more income, instead of hoping it all will work out. You will look back and consider it as one of your best real estate investments.</span></div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Investments","id":"2653"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Brian Hennessey","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780998616308","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780998616308"},"ISBN":"0998616303","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"37"},"Label":"Yajna Publications","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$19.95"},"Manufacturer":"Yajna Publications","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"164","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"37","Length":"900","Weight":"67","Width":"600"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-08-01","Publisher":"Yajna Publications","Studio":"Yajna Publications","Title":"The How to Add Value Handbook for Commercial Real Estate: Generate More Income from Your Investment Property"}}}},{"id":"0814415075","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1692,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.92"},"asin":"0814415075","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Commercial-Mortgages-101-Everything-Winning/dp/0814415075?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0814415075","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Commercial-Mortgages-101-Everything-Winning/dp/0814415075?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0814415075","salesRank":170327,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51C1of3TAbL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51C1of3TAbL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Commercial Mortgages 101: Everything You Need to Know to Create a Winning Loan Request Package","similar":["1511996897","0470174919","0998381624","0470246537","0471684058","0470267607","0071467939","1259586189","0470174668","0998616303"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0814415075&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A36Z&v=2&sig=UIq3cvOHCs6qmiUQqzu8cOh%252FBxPRJxJTq5vvbfzik0M%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"With real estate prices at their lowest in years and the economy poised for a rebound, it's an opportune time to invest in commercial real estate.

Drawing upon four decades of experience developing, owning, and managing properties and on almost thirty years of teaching at the Harvard Business School, William J. Poorvu offers an insider's perspective on how to make smart decisions about real estate.<BR><BR>The real estate “game” is played by people, and it’s the stories of real people that make Poorvu’s introduction to the industry colorful and interesting. You will meet players ranging from real estate moguls to small-scale developers to individual investors in exotic investment instruments. Their stories evolve throughout the book and illustrate how these people—with all their complicated needs, talents, and motives—fit into the larger process and context. <BR> <BR>In clear and nontechnical language, Poorvu explains how variables—players, properties, capital markets, and the external environment—come together to influence the shape and outcome of a real estate deal. He explains the time frame for different kinds of real estate investments and walks the reader through the key “periods of play” in the real estate game: concept, commitment, development, operation, reward, and reinvestment. <BR> <BR><I>The Real Estate Game</I> introduces a simple but powerful “back-of-the-envelope” technique for analyzing the financial implications of a potential deal. Using this tool and others, Poorvu shows readers how to use direct investments, syndicates, and REITs to get into the real estate game across a broad range of property types: residential, office, hotel, industrial, and retail. <BR> <BR>Offering unique insight into the ways that developers and investors can create value, <I>The Real Estate Game</I> is both a perfect introduction for the novice and an invaluable overview for the experienced professional."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"Real estate is as much about people as it is about property, and, after location, success in real estate depends upon understanding the motives of those who play the game, because many critical decisions revolve around what real estate people think, how they act and why. <I>The Real Estate Game</I>, by William J. Poorvu and Jeffrey L. Cruikshank, is a clear, comprehensive overview illustrated with real-life experiences about individual investors, small developers, and moguls. Poorvu has developed and managed real estate and taught real estate investing at the Harvard Business School for over 35 years. This book is drawn from his course, and is designed to help investors make the right decisions derived from the right assumptions and to provide an insider's perspective on how to spot risks and develop strategies that provide protection and adequate investment returns.<p> The book uses the analogy of a game to illustrate some of the intricate and unpredictable interactions in real estate deals, and it lays out the rules of the game, including identification of the key players and periods of play: concept, commitment, development, operation, reward, and reinvestment. Readers are taught to be \"value investors,\" ready to buy at the right price at the right time, because the best opportunities come from buying at a discount-to-replacement cost. The value investor must be prepared to sell at the right juncture, and must not be compelled to be in the game when conditions make the game not worth playing.<p> The case studies that run through the book show how to evaluate, develop, and operate all kinds of real estate investments from the points of view of all involved in the process. There's an extensive appendix covering the different property types, and the authors' \"back-of-the-envelope\" method for analyzing the financial implications of a potential deal is probably worth the book's weight in gold. <I>--Scott Harrison</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Guides","id":"2575"},{"name":"Introduction","id":"2670"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Investments","id":"2653"}],"attributes":{"Author":["William J.

He provides, \"in a form suitable for the laymen, guidance in adoption and execution of an investment policy\" (1). This policy is inherently for the longer term and requires a commitment of effort. Where the speculator follows market trends, the investor uses discipline, research, and his analytical ability to make unpopular but sound investments in bargains relative to current asset value. Graham coaches the investor to develop a rational plan for buying stocks and bonds, and he argues that this plan must be a bulwark against emotional behavior that will always be tempting during abrupt bull and bear markets. <p> Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's investment guide has sold over a million copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" These accolades are well deserved. In its new form--with commentary on each chapter and extensive footnotes prepared by senior <I>Money</I> editor, Jason Zweig--the classic is now updated in light of changes in investment vehicles and market activities since 1972. What remains is a better book. Graham's sage advice, analytical guides, and cautionary tales are still valid for the contemporary investor, and Zweig's commentaries demonstrate the relevance of Graham's principles in light of 1990s and early twenty-first century market trends. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economics","id":"2581"},{"name":"Finance","id":"2604"},{"name":"Introduction","id":"2670"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Benjamin Graham","Jason Zweig"],"Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"HarperBusiness","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["POXM-0060555661","FPS-318894","XM-0060555661","AL06601036"]},"Creator":"Warren E.

In eight teen-friendly sections, the brothers Gardner and writing partner Selena Maranjian demystify the stock market by describing and defining mutual funds, banking practices, IRAs, and drip investing. The authors also include numerous quotes from money-savvy adolescents who detail some of their rookie market moves in an attempt to help their peers steer clear of similar mistakes. Parents will approve of the strongly worded sections on credit card debt and the costly financial and physical tolls a smoking habit takes on both wallet and health. In fact, parents would do well to pick up this investment primer for their own edification, if they find the stock market a confusing and chaotic business. Loaded with worksheets, helpful Web sites on a variety of financial subjects, a concise glossary, and a comprehensive index, this is one investment guide that both generations can and will turn to again and again. <p> Traditionally, teens have been known for having a hard time seeing the proverbial Big Picture. But the Gardners respond admirably to this characteristic, by constantly emphasizing the fortune teens can make in the future by investing now and reminding them that investing money is the least labor-intensive way to make more of the desirable green stuff. A perfect gift for the burgeoning Warren Buffet in your life.

This book can change your life. By following the ten step plan, you can get those phones ringing and deals closing. You'll learn how to analyze properties and control transactions. The authors are active real estate brokers and recommend vendors and websites that help them be their most productive. Investors, as well as licensees, can derive an immediate benefit from this information. The majority of real estate licensees specialize in residential real estate because that is what the \"boot camp\" courses cover. It's difficult to get training in commercial real estate. \"Getting Started in Commercial Real Estate - Ten Step Program to Success!\" will give you the confidence to enter this interesting field and benefit from higher commissions, less competition and no weekend work. The book shows you how to decide on a product specialization, develop expertise in that product type and attract interest from sellers and buyers. Use the sample cold calling scripts to break the ice with potential sellers. Most investors purchase commercial real estate for its income-producing potential, which means the commercial real estate agent needs an understanding of investment analysis. The authors present the basic concepts in an easily understood manner. You will be shown how to reconstruct the seller's operating statement and calculate net operating income, capitalization rate, cash-on-cash return, internal rate of return, present value, net value and future value. You probably won't be a financial expert after reading the material, but you will learn enough to communicate with your clients and determine a reasonable list or offer price. Investors love this chapter! A commercial real estate listing presentation is often a more formal affair than its residential counterpart. You may find yourself in a conference room facing the CEO and his Board of Directors. You need your presentation to shine! The text discusses how to organize the material and to present it in a style that matches your seller's personality. To successfully sell your listings, you want to be in control of advertising, showings and contracts. Most importantly, you have to use an appropriate purchase contract. There are very good reasons not to use the familiar residential purchase contract in a commercial deal. Due diligence periods, hard escrow money and environmental reports are just three of the commercial real estate contractual provisions that are unfamiliar to most residential real estate agents. Read the book and learn how to close the deal in a professional manner. \"Getting Started in Commercial Real Estate - Ten Step Program to Success!\" allows new real estate agents or experienced residential agents to enter the rewarding field of commercial real estate. The book also offers insights and training in financial analysis that many investors will find useful. Don't delay. Get prepared, gain your confidence and start your new career today!"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Investments","id":"2653"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Adam Von Romer CCIM","Patricia O'Connor"],"Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781491022375","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781491022375"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"149102237X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1100","Length":"850","Weight":"79","Width":"33"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2199","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$21.99"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","MPN":"black & white illustrations","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"146","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"33","Length":"1100","Weight":"98","Width":"850"},"PartNumber":"black & white illustrations","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2013-07-27","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"Getting Started in Commercial Real Estate Ten Step Program to Success!"}}}},{"id":"0997515589","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1499,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.99"},"asin":"0997515589","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Successfully-Unemployed-Lessons-Before-Dreams/dp/0997515589?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0997515589","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Successfully-Unemployed-Lessons-Before-Dreams/dp/0997515589?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0997515589","salesRank":1200951,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51spIE0KPtL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51spIE0KPtL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Successfully Unemployed: 16 Real Life Lessons You Must Learn Before You Quit Your Job and Live the Life of Your Dreams","similar":["0997515554","0997515511","1612549209","0998381624","198043509X","1530663946","0989894509","0984358161","0997584750","1119363322"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0997515589&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A38Z&v=2&sig=FGNNtq6wZW53XoIKYT%252B7QwgN96ETYnDZ%252FRyM4bzil2o%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Many people desire to quit their job, few actually do.

Survey 1,371 more millionaires and write <I>The Millionaire Mind</I>. Dr. Stanley's extremely timely tome is a mixture of entertaining elements. It resembles Regis Philbin's hit show (and CD-ROM game) <I>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</I>, only you have to pose real-life questions, instead of quizzing about trivia. Are you a gambling, divorce-prone, conspicuously consuming \"Income-Statement Affluent\" Jacuzzi fool soon to be parted from his or her money, or a frugal, loyal, resole your shoes and buy your own groceries type like one of Stanley's \"Balance-Sheet Affluent\" millionaires? \"Cheap dates,\" millionaires are 4.9 times likelier to play with their grandkids than shop at Brooks Brothers. \"If you asked the average American what it takes to be a millionaire,\" he writes, \"they'd probably cite a number of predictable factors: inheritance, luck, stock market investments.... Topping his list would be a high IQ, high SAT scores and gradepoint average, along with attendance at a top college.\" No way, says Stanley, backing it up with data he compiled with help from the University of Georgia and Harvard geodemographer Jon Robbin. Robbin may wish he'd majored in socializing at L.S.U., instead, because the numbers show the average millionaire had a lowly 2.92 GPA, SAT scores between 1100 and 1190, and teachers who told them they were mediocre students but personable people. \"Discipline 101 and Tenacity 102\" made them rich. Stanley got straight C's in English and writing, but he had money-minded drive. He urges you to pattern your life according to Yale professor Robert Sternberg's <I>Successful Intelligence</I>, because Stanley's statistics bear out Sternberg's theories on what makes minds succeed--and it ain't IQ.<p> Besides offering insights into millionaires' pinchpenny ways, pleasing quips (\"big brain, no bucks\"), and 46 statistical charts with catchy titles, Stanley's book booms with human-potential pep talk and bristles with anecdotes--for example, about a bus driver who made $3 million, a doctor (reporting that his training gave him zero people skills) who lost $1.5 million, and a loser scholar in the bottom 10 percent on six GRE tests who grew up to be Martin Luther King Jr. Read it and you'll feel like a million bucks. <I>--Tim Appelo</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Success","id":"4749"},{"name":"Guides","id":"2575"},{"name":"Finance","id":"2604"},{"name":"Introduction","id":"2670"},{"name":"Budgeting & Money Management","id":"2719"},{"name":"Personality","id":"11194"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Thomas J.

But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies today aren't managing their knowledge workers careers. Instead, you must be your own chief executive officer. That means it's up to you to carve out your place in the world and know when to change course. And it's up to you to keep yourself engaged and productive during a career that may span some 50 years. In <i>Managing Oneself</i>, Peter Drucker explains how to do it. The keys: Cultivate a deep understanding of yourself by identifying your most valuable strengths and most dangerous weaknesses; Articulate how you learn and work with others and what your most deeply held values are; and Describe the type of work environment where you can make the greatest contribution. Only when you operate with a combination of your strengths and self-knowledge can you achieve true and lasting excellence. <i>Managing Oneself</i> identifies the probing questions you need to ask to gain the insights essential for taking charge of your career.

Originally published in 1930, it seeks to answer several questions fundamental to human society and its organization: What influences led to the creation of civilization? Why and how did it come to be? What determines civilization’s trajectory? Freud’s theories on the effect of the knowledge of death on human existence and the birth of art are central to his work. Of the various English translations of Freud’s major works to appear in his lifetime, only Norton’s Standard Edition, under the general editorship of James Strachey, was authorized by Freud himself.

Professor Dawkins articulates a gene's eye view of evolution - a view giving centre stage to these persistent units of information, and in which organisms can be seen as vehicles for their replication. This imaginative, powerful, and stylistically brilliant work not only brought the insights of Neo-Darwinism to a wide audience, but galvanized the biology community, generating much debate and stimulating whole new areas of research. Forty years later, its insights remain as relevant today as on the day it was published. <br><br>This 40th anniversary edition includes a new epilogue from the author discussing the continuing relevance of these ideas in evolutionary biology today, as well as the original prefaces and foreword, and extracts from early reviews. <br> <br>Oxford Landmark Science books are 'must-read' classics of modern science writing which have crystallized big ideas, and shaped the way we think.<br>"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson, and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of <I>The Selfish Gene</I>. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that \"our\" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since. <P> Why are there miles and miles of \"unused\" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or <I>memes</I>, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation.

This paperback includes a new preface from the author.</strong></p><p>Whether we're buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401(k), everyday decisions—both big and small—have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented.</p><p>As Americans, we assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression.</p><p>In <em>The Paradox of Choice</em>, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice—the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish—becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice—from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs—has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.</p><p>By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counter intuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Self-Help","id":"4736"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"Social Psychology & Interactions","id":"11223"},{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","id":"226685"},{"name":"Popular Culture","id":"4556"},{"name":"Cultural","id":"11235"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Barry Schwartz","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"imusti","EAN":"9780062449924","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780062449924"},"Edition":"Revised","Feature":"HARPER COLLINS PUBLISHERS","ISBN":"0062449923","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"800","Length":"531","Width":"68"},"Label":"Ecco","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1599","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$15.99"},"Manufacturer":"Ecco","MPN":"43410534","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"304","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"110","Length":"790","Weight":"50","Width":"520"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"43410534","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-05-17","Publisher":"Ecco","ReleaseDate":"2016-05-17","Studio":"Ecco","Title":"The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less, Revised Edition"}}}},{"id":"198047947X","data":{"width":62,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":999,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$9.99"},"asin":"198047947X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Real-Estate-Secrets-Success/dp/198047947X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=198047947X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Real-Estate-Secrets-Success/dp/198047947X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=198047947X","salesRank":127669,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jg3HrM2UL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"124"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jg3HrM2UL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"386"},"title":"Winning Real Estate: 9 Secrets to Success from Leading Pros","similar":["1945507357","1523610840","1718854765","1544986157","0998354503","1483470059","1518671594","0307453723","1544500416","0071444041"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=198047947X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A39Z&v=2&sig=SkJXrv2Pkdow0a7vPUMRHG%252BvPWkRFNpwbjlCHENaA1k%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Grow your sales with winning tips from nationally recognized Century 21 Real Estate Agents.

Design & implement the strategies to grow your business and dominate your market! The HyperLocal HyperFast Real Estate Agent returns! After achieving best-seller status on Amazon and selling thousands of copies around the globe last year, real estate broker, coach and author Daniel Lesniak follows up the HyperLocal HyperFast Real Estate Agent with the accompanying Companion Guide – a workbook designed to help you find and establish the structures and strategies needed to reach your maximum potential. An extension from the first book, this Companion Guide shifts the initiative into your hands, with Dan as your trusted mentor guiding you along the way. With several years of first-hand experience coaching up-and-coming agents (and overseeing his own team of agents at Optime Realty) to go along with 5+ years as one of the most successful real estate brokers in the country, Dan has the proven pedigree to effectively prepare you for success. A central tenet to Dan’s approach is the concept of finding your \"Big Why” – the driving motivator that will bring out the best in you. We all have to work to survive, but the most successful people are those who figure out a way to love the work that they do; not only do they enjoy the work itself, but also through that love they in turn produce superior work. Among the most effective ways to achieving this work-love relationship is by providing a service that is of real, substantive value to the people in your community. In this Companion Guide, Dan offers insight into his mindset in order to push you to find your \"Big Why.\" Though written primarily for up-and-coming ambitious real estate agents, the tactics discussed here are universal strategies that can be applied to any field or profession. The paperback contains 11 chapters guiding you through Dan’s proven approach and methodologies, with writing exercises and thought experiments throughout to convert his approaches and strategies into your own unique ideas."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Buying & Selling Homes","id":"2651"},{"name":"Investments","id":"2653"},{"name":"Studying & Workbooks","id":"5267723011"},{"name":"Real Estate","id":"684249011"},{"name":"Test Prep & Study Guides","id":"684300011"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Daniel James Lesniak","Keri Shull"],"Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780998354521","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780998354521"},"Edition":"First Edition","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"099835452X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1100","Length":"850","Width":"30"},"Label":"DKB Publishing","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2999","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.99"},"Manufacturer":"DKB Publishing","NumberOfPages":"130","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"30","Length":"1100","Weight":"88","Width":"850"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-02-07","Publisher":"DKB Publishing","Studio":"DKB Publishing","Title":"The HyperLocal HyperFast Real Estate Agent Companion Guide: Develop & Implement the Strategies to Dominate Your Market!"}}}},{"id":"0999082817","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1995,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$19.95"},"asin":"0999082817","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Sell-100-Homes-Year-Engagement/dp/0999082817?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0999082817","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Sell-100-Homes-Year-Engagement/dp/0999082817?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0999082817","salesRank":72994,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MmaUQv5hL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MmaUQv5hL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Sell 100+ Homes A Year: How We Use Engagement Marketing, Technology and Lead Gen to Sell 100+ Homes A Year, Every Year!","similar":["1945507357","1718854765","1544986157","0692905669","171781056X","1483470059","194258900X","1540755193","1523610840","1942589239"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0999082817&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A40Z&v=2&sig=BLzOE%252BlCJh2pt7LKppO1yI8DuogqY2Dqrd4ESJ%252Fkg7s%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Whether you’ve been in real estate for 18 days or 18 years, if you haven’t achieved the success you really want, you need to read this book. You entered real estate for the upside: interesting work, flexible hours, and the potential to make good money, right? But the median gross income for the 1.2 million REALTORS® in the United States is just over $42,000 per year! That’s about $21 per hour (if you only work 40 hours per week) with no paid vacation, no paid sick leave, and rarely any company health insurance plan. Is this what you signed up for? You’re a goal-setter and a go-getter. You work hard and you’re smart. You’ve learned the business and put long hours into it. Yet, it still seems like a struggle. Always chasing your next client, listing, or commission check. Spending weekends and evenings on work, not with family. Getting tossed around by a market you can’t control. You’ve done everything you’ve been taught, but it’s still not enough. What’s the secret? Doing things differently than you’ve ever been taught. Krista Mashore says, “I’ve been in the Top 1% of all Realtors nationally for 15 years, not because I’m smarter or work harder than everyone else. It’s because I research and implement specific techniques that catapult me to where I am.” In this book, Krista Mashore will give you step by step instructions and show you how to: • Close over 90% of your listing presentations before you even walk in the door. • Generate legitimate leads while you sleep. • Use the secrets of Fortune 500 companies to build an active and loyal client base. • Use socialized marketing to gain your community’s respect and become the go-to Community Market Leader® in your area. • Make over 100 deals per year (or whatever your goal is) using the power of social media and technology. • Create a business model that fits your desired lifestyle and gives you true time flexibility. • Build a sustainable business with a consistent, reliable income stream— no matter what the market is doing! “If you implement even 50% of what I recommend in this book, I know your business will at least double within the first eighteen months.” — Krista Mashore Based in Northern California, Realtor® Krista Mashore sold 69 homes in her first year and has personally sold over 100 homes every year since. On track to sell 200 homes this year, Krista now also coaches and trains brokers and agents throughout the U.S. on cutting edge real estate techniques and technologies."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Certification & Development","id":"3048961"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Krista Lynn Mashore","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780999082812","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780999082812"},"ISBN":"0999082817","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"58"},"Label":"Community Market Leader","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$19.95"},"Manufacturer":"Community Market Leader","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"254","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"58","Length":"900","Weight":"98","Width":"600"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-12-27","Publisher":"Community Market Leader","Studio":"Community Market Leader","Title":"Sell 100+ Homes A Year: How We Use Engagement Marketing, Technology and Lead Gen to Sell 100+ Homes A Year, Every Year!"}}}},{"id":"0692905669","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1295,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$12.95"},"asin":"0692905669","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-Real-Estate-Team/dp/0692905669?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0692905669","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-Real-Estate-Team/dp/0692905669?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0692905669","salesRank":173697,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RUIeQ7zPL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RUIeQ7zPL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"The Million Dollar Real Estate Team: How I Went from Zero to Earning 1 Million after Expenses in Three Years","similar":["1945507357","1718854765","0998354503","0999082817","1544986157","1544500416","1942589239","1523610840","0071444041","1540755193"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0692905669&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-29T05%3A22%3A40Z&v=2&sig=xenuksK4SnVSBoJ80fVs6PgK97vmfxcWRQUd%252BYXDUvM%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Ever feel like you can’t jump off the real estate merry-go-round of listing appointments, property showings and one transactional fire after another?

These are the essential traits which make an entity what it is. Essentialism is a book which deals with situations wherein people would find themselves in the middle of an information explosion. They could also feel occupied with a lot of work, but still be unproductive. There are times when people follow the notion that they have to do everything, but on the contrary, they end up doing nothing. There is no specific direction to their tasks and neither to their goals. Essentialism as a concept narrows down this notion into doing the right things which are absolutely necessary, in a right manner and at the right time. It is about categorising things as important and unimportant as per one's personal goals, and doing only the important things. This ensures that there is a proper channel for one's energy, time, and effort, which can be applied to a specific goal in order to achieve it. Essentialism, the book, helps the readers in adopting this disciplined way of thinking which can be practiced and applied in real-life scenarios to achieve lasting success. It is an approach adopted by successful people of top-notch companies, which can now be used by any common man. This book was published by virgin books in 2014, and is available in paperback."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Self-Help","id":"4736"},{"name":"Health, Fitness &
