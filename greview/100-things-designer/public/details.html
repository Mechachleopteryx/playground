<p>Indeed he was right! Looking at this auto-generated graph of also-boughts from Amazon, we can see that <a class='accent'

    Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> stands in the middle of the world, where:
  <ul>
    <li>
      East is taken by practical engineering: Algorithms, Design Patterns, Architecture
    </li>
    <li>West is taken by distributed systems: Machine Learning, Hadoop</li>
    <li>And the South is guarded by SRE and DevOps.</li>
  </ul>

<h5>Personal Opinion</h5>
<p>
  I think <a class='accent' href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1449373321">
    Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> is a fundamental book, that should be in the library of every software engineer.
  In my mental bookshelf its place is next to the industry's classics (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0201633612"
    class='accent'>Design Patterns</a>,

    class='accent'>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0132350882"
    class='accent'>Clean Code</a>).
</p>
<p>The book's narrative is multidimensional, engaging, and complete. It touches past, present and future of the data management
  systems. At one moment you are diving deep into data storage formats, and at the other you are soaring high in the world
  of distributed data.
</p>
<p>I am a very slow reader, and I spent 33 hours reading this book. I never regret it.</p>
