Yes, with this level of attention being paid to “innovation”, it feels like “innovation has arrived!” It has made a splash in the world, especially in the world of business! But, what does this really mean to an organization? How does this energy and enthusiasm impact a person’s daily activities at work? </p> <p>Innovation wins customers, creates competitive advantage, and increases profit for organizations. But it’s also a notoriously risky venture to enter into, resulting in extremely low success rates and reluctance on the part of investors and decision-makers to support it. Does innovation have to be so risky and unpredictable? </p> <p>I’m attacking these issues head on by articulating a vision of a reliable, repeatable, and structured approach for driving innovation in organizations. </p> <p>This vision is shaped by five basic insights about innovation. </p> <p><b>1. Innovation is a discipline, not a mystery. </b></p> <p>Practicing innovation is not a mystery, contrary to what most people believe. Innovation is a discipline. It can be planned, practiced, improved, and excelled at. It can be formalized as a disciplined process. We can approach the practice of innovation (creating new products, services, and customer experiences) like a science, with a set of practical and rigorous methods, tools, and frameworks. </p> <p><b>2. Innovation process needs clear modes, mindsets, and methods. </b> </p> <p> Modes provide innovators the focus necessary to deal with complex innovation challenges. Mindsets provide them with clear ways of thinking to fully understand challenges and appropriately conceive responses. Methods facilitate step-by-step actions to reach desired outcomes and end goals. This way of framing structured innovation is particularly valuable for innovators to effectively work together as teams. </p> <div class=\"rightImage\" style=\"width: 350px;\"> <img alt=\"Design Methods Bonus Content\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/wiley/2012/DesiginMethods1118083466BonusContent-thumb._V386593385_.jpg\" width=\"350\" /></div> <p><b>3. Four primary forces shape innovations. </b></p> <p>The primary forces that shape successful innovations are business, technology, design, and society. Business force relates to the question of what is viable in the market -- where are the market gaps and how to fill them. Technology force looks for what is possible with new emerging technologies and how to create new offerings. Design force asks the question of what is desirable for people and how to create humanized solutions. Society force is focused on what is sustainable for the community and the environment. Integrating these forces produce innovations that deliver higher user and economic value. </p> <p><b>4. Innovations need collaboration and teamwork. </b></p> <p>Innovations use structured and disciplined processes in which all stakeholders participate. For example, engineers, technologists, business analysts, strategists, researchers, designers, social scientists, community members, and even end-users participate in the process. Collaborative thinking at many levels of the organization is needed to conceive reliable solutions. </p> <p><b>5. The same generic process benefits many diverse projects. </b></p> <p>A generalized innovation process -- comprehensively conceived for observing, reframing, ideating, prototyping, and planning -- can be used to develop a wide variety of concepts like products, services, experiences, messages, channels, business models, or strategies. It can also support the needs of various types of organizations -- corporate businesses, social organizations, governments, entrepreneurs, or networked organizations. </p> </div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Techniques","id":"1863"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Education & Reference","id":"2732"},{"name":"Organizational Learning","id":"171127"},{"name":"Research & Development","id":"10020723011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Vijay Kumar","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"John Wiley Sons","EAN":"9781118083468","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9781118083468","8601401204565"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"John Wiley Sons","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1118083466","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"730","Weight":"150","Width":"70"},"Label":"Wiley","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3495","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$34.95"},"Manufacturer":"Wiley","MPN":"43171-585925","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"336","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"63","Length":"906","Weight":"150","Width":"748"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"43171-585925","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2012-10-09","Publisher":"Wiley","Studio":"Wiley","Title":"101 Design Methods: A Structured Approach for Driving Innovation in Your Organization"}}}},{"id":"1118113365","data":{"width":54.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1982,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$19.82"},"asin":"1118113365","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Brainfluence-Persuade-Convince-Consumers-Neuromarketing/dp/1118113365?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1118113365","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Brainfluence-Persuade-Convince-Consumers-Neuromarketing/dp/1118113365?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1118113365","salesRank":49554,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MUvGTJyQL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"109"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MUvGTJyQL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"342"},"title":"Brainfluence: 100 Ways to Persuade and Convince Consumers with Neuromarketing","similar":["1137278927","1591847788","0385523890","0615815650","0470601779","1416576142","0385531737","099439022X","0887306667","1118518586"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1118113365&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A27Z&v=2&sig=rvNqmW8l1%252BNrQFRL9jgfOlTWP1eo8xG%252FgbPCXgwSdkQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>Practical techniques for applying neuroscience and behaviorresearch to attract new customers</b> <p><i>Brainfluence</i> explains how to practically applyneuroscience and behavior research to better market to consumers byunderstanding their decision patterns.

You wear a certain jacket because you liked how it looked. You picked a particular career because you found it interesting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions is patently obvious. Right? Wrong.<BR> <BR>Without our realizing it, other people’s behavior has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane to the momentous. Even strangers have an impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes toward a welfare policy shift if we’re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans (even though the policy is the same). But social influence doesn’t just lead us to do the same things as others. In some cases we imitate others around us. But in other cases we <i>avoid</i> particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don’t want to look like a soccer mom.<BR> <BR>By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it—and learn how we can use this knowledge to exercise more control over our own behavior. In <i>Invisible Influence</i>, Jonah Berger “is consistently entertaining, applying science to real life in surprising ways and explaining research through narrative.

When we make things for others to use, the architecture of information that we choose greatly affects our ability to deliver our intended message to our users.

The second edition also includes a new section on web design and new discussions of modularity, framing, motion and time, rules of randomness, and numerous quotes supported by images and biographies. This pioneering work provides designers, art directors, and students―regardless of experience―with a unique approach to successful design. Veteran designer and educator Alex. W. White has assembled a wealth of information and examples in his exploration of what makes visual design stunning and easy to read. Readers will discover White's four elements of graphic design, including how to: define and reveal dominant images, words, and concepts; use scale, color, and position to guide the viewer through levels of importance; employ white space as a significant component of design and not merely as background; and use display and text type for maximum comprehension and value to the reader. Offering a new way to think about and use the four design elements, this book is certain to inspire better design.</p> Allworth Press, an imprint of Skyhorse Publishing, publishes a broad range of books on the visual and performing arts, with emphasis on the business of art.

They don't make us feel happier or richer. Why are they not designed as well as the products we love to use such as an Apple iPod or a BMW? The 'developed' world has moved beyond the industrial mindset of products and the majority of 'products' that we encounter are actually parts of a larger service network. These services comprise people, technology, places, time and objects that form the entire service experience. In most cases some of the touchpoints are designed, but in many situations the service as a complete ecology just \"happens\" and is not consciously designed at all, which is why they don't feel like iPods or BMWs. One of the goals of service design is to redress this imbalance and to design services that have the same appeal and experience as the products we love, whether it is buying insurance, going on holiday, filling in a tax return, or having a heart transplant. Another important aspect of service design is its potential for design innovation and intervention in the big issues facing us, such as transport, sustainability, government, finance, communications and healthcare. Given that we live in a service and information age, a practical, thoughtful book about how to design better services is urgently needed."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Subjects","id":"1000"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Andy Polaine","Lavrans Løvlie","Ben Reason"],"Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781933820330","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781933820330"},"Edition":"1st","ISBN":"1933820330","ItemDimensions":{"Weight":"100"},"Label":"Rosenfeld Media","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3900","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$39.00"},"Manufacturer":"Rosenfeld Media","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"216","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"50","Length":"890","Weight":"100","Width":"590"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2013-03-13","Publisher":"Rosenfeld Media","Studio":"Rosenfeld Media","Title":"Service Design: From Insight to Implementation"}}}},{"id":"1933820586","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":3900,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$39.00"},"asin":"1933820586","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Build-Better-Products-Successful-User-Centered/dp/1933820586?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1933820586","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Build-Better-Products-Successful-User-Centered/dp/1933820586?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1933820586","salesRank":580874,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ez0ijJcVL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ez0ijJcVL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Build Better Products: A Modern Approach to Building Successful User-Centered Products","similar":["1933820314","1933820292","193382011X","1933820187","193382073X","149197172X","1491960604","1491904909","1491953608","1491923539"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1933820586&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A32Z&v=2&sig=%252Fsaf%252Fw5pd4lOfoRX0YOn4xae757nudHPeFyX%252BIvQbCQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"It s easier than ever to build a new product.

Wrong. Good research is about asking more and better questions, and thinking critically about the answers. It's something every member of your team can and should do, and which everyone can learn, quickly. And done well, it will save you time and money by reducing unknowns and creating a solid foundation to build the right thing, in the most effective way. In Just Enough Research, co-founder of Mule Design Erika Hall distills her experience into a brief cookbook of research methods. Learn how to discover your competitive advantages, spot your own blind spots and biases, understand and harness your findings, and why you should never, ever hold a focus group. You'll start doing good research faster than you can plan your next pitch. Erika Hall has been working in web design and development since the late 20th century. In 2001, she co-founded Mule Design Studio where she directs the research, interaction design, and strategy practices.

We cannot let the brave new world that technology is currently creating simply emerge. All of us need to help shape the future we want to live in. But what do we need to know and do to achieve this? <br> <br> World Economic Forum Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab's 2016 book, <i>The Fourth Industrial Revolution</i>, revealed the extent of change tearing through our world. We live at a momentous time in history, one where it is up to us, today, to make sure our technologically-enriched future is safe, ethical, inclusive and sustainable. <br> <br> This book, <i>Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution</i>, builds on these ideas to demonstrate how people from all backgrounds and sectors can influence the way that technology transforms our world. It draws on contributions by more than 200 of the world's leading technology, economic and sociological experts to present a practical guide for citizens, business leaders, social influencers and policy-makers. <i>Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution</i> outlines the most important dynamics of the technology revolution, highlights important stakeholders that are often overlooked in our discussion of the latest scientific breakthroughs, and explores 12 different technology areas central to the future of humanity. <br> <br> Emerging technologies are not predetermined forces out of our control, nor are they simple tools with known impacts and consequences. The exciting capabilities provided by artificial intelligence, distributed ledger systems and cryptocurrencies, advanced materials and biotechnologies are already transforming society. The actions we take today – and those we don't – will quickly become embedded in ever-more powerful technologies that surround us and will, very soon, become an integral part of us. <br> <br> By connecting the dots across a range of often-misunderstood technologies, and by exploring the practical steps that individuals, businesses and governments can take, <i>Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution</i> helps equip readers to shape a truly desirable future at a time of great uncertainty and change."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Development & Growth","id":"2585"},{"name":"Engineering","id":"173515"},{"name":"Social Aspects","id":"271634011"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Klaus Schwab","Nicholas Davis"],"Binding":"Paperback","Creator":"Satya Nadella","EAN":"9781944835149","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781944835149"},"IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1944835148","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"65"},"Label":"World Economic Forum","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$14.99"},"Manufacturer":"World Economic Forum","NumberOfPages":"287","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"87","Length":"898","Weight":"101","Width":"606"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-01-11","Publisher":"World Economic Forum","Studio":"World Economic Forum","Title":"Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution"}}}},{"id":"0321767535","data":{"width":58,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2228,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$22.28"},"asin":"0321767535","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Things-Designer-People-Voices-Matter/dp/0321767535?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321767535","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Things-Designer-People-Voices-Matter/dp/0321767535?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321767535","salesRank":20002,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WypjNOT9L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"116"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WypjNOT9L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"361"},"title":"100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People (Voices That Matter)","similar":["0321965515","0465050654","1118766571","0134196031","0465051367","0321683684","1491953608","0321657292","1933820187","1592535879"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0321767535&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A21Z&v=2&sig=gjPcgNSx804QHopOMQLUj3dqE%252BzyO0oU69g5YHmYUds%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"We design to elicit responses from people.

In this book, he takes his thinking several steps farther, showing that successful design must incorporate not just what users need, but must address our minds by attending to our visceral reactions, to our behavioral choices, and to the stories we want the things in our lives to tell others about ourselves. Good human-centered design isn't just about making effective tools that are straightforward to use; it's about making affective tools that mesh well with our emotions and help us express our identities and support our social lives. From roller coasters to robots, sports cars to smart phones, attractive things work better. Whether designer or consumer, user or inventor, this book is the definitive guide to making Norman's insights work for you.</br></br></div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"History","id":"518510"},{"name":"Decorative Arts","id":"1851"},{"name":"Furniture Design","id":"1852"},{"name":"Design History & Criticism","id":"3564963011"},{"name":"Industrial & Product Design","id":"3564966011"},{"name":"History & Criticism","id":"1064"},{"name":"Fashion Design","id":"1844"},{"name":"Branding & Logo Design","id":"3564965011"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Advertising","id":"2699"},{"name":"Consumer Behavior","id":"2700"},{"name":"Education & Reference","id":"2732"},{"name":"Research & Development","id":"10020723011"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"Knowledge Capital","id":"10020685011"},{"name":"Robotics","id":"3897"},{"name":"Internet, Groupware, & Telecommunications","id":"3705"},{"name":"Emotions","id":"11170"},{"name":"Physiological Aspects","id":"11196"},{"name":"Interior Decorating","id":"11160418011"},{"name":"Robotics & Automation","id":"13687"},{"name":"Products","id":"7921653011"},{"name":"Patents & Inventions","id":"52156011"},{"name":"Telecommunications & Sensors","id":"13809"},{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","id":"573358"},{"name":"Cognitive","id":"15811861"},{"name":"General","id":"6511988011"},{"name":"Popular Culture","id":"4556"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Don Norman","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Basic Books AZ","EAN":"9780465051366","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601404701894","8601300280684","9780465051366"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Basic Books AZ","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0465051367","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"813","Length":"538","Weight":"57","Width":"75"},"Label":"Basic Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1799","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$17.99"},"Manufacturer":"Basic Books","MPN":"9780465051366","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"272","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"61","Length":"800","Weight":"83","Width":"520"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780465051366","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2005-05-11","Publisher":"Basic Books","ReleaseDate":"2005-05-11","Studio":"Basic Books","Title":"Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things"}}}},{"id":"0321683684","data":{"width":62,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2480,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$24.80"},"asin":"0321683684","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Elements-User-Experience-User-Centered-Design/dp/0321683684?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321683684","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Elements-User-Experience-User-Centered-Design/dp/0321683684?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321683684","salesRank":47324,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Sx6GINP8L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"124"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Sx6GINP8L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"389"},"title":"The Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web and Beyond (2nd Edition) (Voices That Matter)","similar":["0321965515","1118766571","0321794435","0321657292","0321767535","0465050654","0321815386","1933820187","1491911689","1491953608"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0321683684&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A22Z&v=2&sig=5hc%252FMw1jXbCPzMkWfAG6NMQW7XSfExo9cAxAfRpX6BY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">From the moment it was published almost ten years ago, <i>Elements of User Experience</i> became a vital reference for web and interaction designers the world over, and has come to define the core principles of the practice.

The Humane Interface is a gourmet dish from a master chef. Five mice! --Jakob Nielsen, Nielsen Norman Group Author of Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity This unique guide to interactive system design reflects the experience and vision of Jef Raskin, the creator of the Apple Macintosh. Other books may show how to use todays widgets and interface ideas effectively. Raskin, however, demonstrates that many current interface paradigms are dead ends, and that to make computers significantly easier to use requires new approaches. He explains how to effect desperately needed changes, offering a wealth of innovative and specific interface ideas for software designers, developers, and product managers. The Apple Macintosh helped to introduce a previous revolution in computer interface design, drawing on the best available technology to establish many of the interface techniques and methods now universal in the computer industry. With this book, Raskin proves again both his farsightedness and his practicality. He also demonstrates how design ideas must be bui"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"\"The book that explains why you really hate computers.\"<p> I've admired Jef Raskin for years. For those who don't know, he is the \"Father of the Macintosh,\" one of the original geniuses who guided the Mac in the early days. But, more than a computer scientist, Raskin is a cognitive psychologist. He studies how the brain works with special emphasis on how that relates to us using computers. His magnum opus was the Canon Cat, which was an excellent and well-thought-out little computer.<p> In <I>The Humane Interface</I>, Raskin goes into detail describing how computers can be made easier to understand and use. Ever want to know why you really don't like Windows? The answer is in this book. In fact, there's so much in this book that makes sense, I really want to send a copy to every employee at Microsoft. <p> I loved reading this book and nodding my head in rabid agreement. Raskin states, \"There has never been any technical reason for a computer to take more than a few seconds to begin operation when it is turned on.\" So why then does Windows (or Linux!) take so darn long to start up? The PalmPilot is on instantly, as is your cell phone. But for some reason, we tolerate the computer taking a few eons to start. (And until consumers complain about it, things won't change.)<p> Computers can be easy to use, and the people who design them and design software need to read this book. Do you ever get the impression that the person who designed a piece of software must have come from the same company that designed the front panel on your VCR? Why should you have to double-click anything? What does Ctrl+D mean one thing in one program and a completely different thing in another? And what's the point of the Yes/No confirmation if the user is in the habit of clicking Yes without thinking about it? Raskin neatly probes all these areas.<p> While I admire everything Raskin has to say, the book is pretty heavy on the psychology end. Myself, I enjoy cognitive psychology (especially books by Raskin's cohort Donald Norman), though some may find that part of the book boring. Even so, Raskin builds and backs his argument in a most eloquent and scientific manner. Especially if you design software or need to teach or train people to use computers, this book deserves a spot on your shelf. <I>--Dan Gookin</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Systems Analysis & Design","id":"602672"},{"name":"Games & Strategy Guides","id":"87"},{"name":"User Experience & Usability","id":"4033"},{"name":"Computer Science","id":"468204"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jef Raskin","Binding":"Paperback","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"AL07005168"},"Color":"Blue","EAN":"9780201379372","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780201379372"},"ISBN":"0201379376","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"910","Length":"620","Weight":"110","Width":"60"},"Label":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"5499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$54.99"},"Manufacturer":"Addison-Wesley Professional","MPN":"2705412002 015","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"256","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"79","Length":"937","Weight":"110","Width":"768"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"2705412002 015","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2000-04-08","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Studio":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Title":"The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems"}}}},{"id":"0321815386","data":{"width":62.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2812,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$28.12"},"asin":"0321815386","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Project-Guide-Design-experience-designers/dp/0321815386?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321815386","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Project-Guide-Design-experience-designers/dp/0321815386?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321815386","salesRank":44658,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414W43nzOUL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"125"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414W43nzOUL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"390"},"title":"A Project Guide to UX Design: For user experience designers in the field or in the making (2nd Edition) (Voices That Matter)","similar":["0321683684","0321965515","0465050654","1118766571","1491911689","0321767535","1449372864","1491953608","0124079148","1631593749"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0321815386&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A22Z&v=2&sig=a7sriI1UKvxEHgXjvOGGi0CR9zNCmJyUS6kcyRMUOMs%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"User experience design is the discipline of creating a useful and usable Web site or application that’s easily navigated and meets the needs of the site owner and its users.

Focusing on storytelling techniques that work best for digital media, this book describes the essential skills and tools in a Web author’s toolbox, including a thorough understanding of grammar and style, a critical eye for photography, and an ear for just the right sound byte for a podcast. <br> <br> This clearly written guide provides a fun and practical approach to Web writing that busy students and writers will be eager to learn and explore. <br> <ul> <li>Uses concise, straight-to-the-point style to illustrate techniques for writing sharp and focused Web copy, coupled with compelling visuals and sound</li> </ul> <ul> <li> Focuses on writing practices and guidelines, with exercises and prompts developed and tested by the author</li> </ul> <ul> <li> Features clear design, with plenty of pictures and visual elements, and a friendly and knowledgeable voice</li> </ul>Take your learning even further with Lynda's companion book: <i>The Web Writer's Toolkit: 365 prompts, collaborative exercises, games, and challenges for effective online content</i>.<br> <br>For more tips, exercises, and suggestions for teachers, check out the book’s Web site at www.write4web.com.<br> <br>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Web Design","id":"3525"},{"name":"Internet & Social Media","id":"69766"},{"name":"Fiction","id":"12022"},{"name":"Computer Science","id":"468204"},{"name":"Creative Writing & Composition","id":"491394"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Lynda Felder","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780321794437","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780321794437"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"0321794435","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"880","Length":"690","Weight":"55","Width":"40"},"Label":"New Riders","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2999","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.99"},"Manufacturer":"New Riders","MPN":"9780321794437","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"192","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"40","Length":"890","Weight":"55","Width":"700"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780321794437","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2011-11-06","Publisher":"New Riders","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-27","Studio":"New Riders","Title":"Writing for the Web: Creating Compelling Web Content Using Words, Pictures, and Sound"}}}},{"id":"150112174X","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1526,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$15.26"},"asin":"150112174X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=150112174X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=150112174X","salesRank":4196,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512V%2BzNxQ9L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512V%2BzNxQ9L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days","similar":["1118960874","1591847788","1119387507","1491923172","1491953608","0307887898","1119467470","0465050654","1491960604","0525536221"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=150112174X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A23Z&v=2&sig=SUeFVY6uVbt4W439Xr3u9VKHHIy5MvkBy%252BQJr08e%252BxU%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER</b><BR> <b><i>WALL STREET JOURNAL</i> BESTSELLER</b><BR> <BR><b>“<i>Sprint</i> offers a transformative formula for testing ideas that works whether you’re at a startup or a large organization.

Contrary to popular belief, they didn’t explode to massive worldwide popularity simply by building  a great product then crossing their fingers and hoping it would catch on. There was a studied, carefully implemented methodology behind these companies’ extraordinary rise. That methodology is called Growth Hacking, and it’s practitioners include not just today’s hottest start-ups, but also companies like IBM, Walmart, and Microsoft as well as the millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, managers and executives who make up the community of Growth Hackers.<br><br> Think of the Growth Hacking methodology as doing for market-share growth what Lean Start-Up did for product development, and Scrum did for productivity. It involves cross-functional teams and rapid-tempo testing and iteration that focuses <i>customers</i>: attaining them, retaining them, engaging them, and motivating them to come back and buy more.   <br> <b><br> </b>An accessible and practical toolkit that teams and companies in all industries can use to increase their customer base and market share, this book walks readers through the process of creating and executing their own custom-made growth hacking strategy. It is a must read for any marketer, entrepreneur, innovator or manger looking to replace wasteful big bets and \"spaghetti-on-the-wall\" approaches with more consistent, replicable, cost-effective, and data-driven results."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Consumer Behavior","id":"2700"},{"name":"Direct","id":"2703"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Sean Ellis","Morgan Brown"],"Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"CROWN BUSINESS","EAN":"9780451497215","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780451497215"},"Feature":"CROWN BUSINESS","ISBN":"045149721X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"950","Length":"640","Weight":"111","Width":"110"},"Label":"Currency","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2900","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.00"},"Manufacturer":"Currency","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"320","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"909","Weight":"115","Width":"610"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-04-25","Publisher":"Currency","ReleaseDate":"2017-04-25","Studio":"Currency","Title":"Hacking Growth: How Today's Fastest-Growing Companies Drive Breakout Success"}}}},{"id":"0307887898","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1605,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.05"},"asin":"0307887898","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0307887898","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0307887898","salesRank":1562,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51T-sMqSMiL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51T-sMqSMiL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses","similar":["0804139296","0062273205","1449335675","1101903201","0470876417","0984999302","1721514066","0989200507","0691158304","1449305172"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0307887898&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A25Z&v=2&sig=nNmi3zKFJaLmubGOdevldCZhO6VTJ%252BtHXblEqLjVWvk%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><b>Most startups fail.

This handbook equips people in various lines of work to become more innovative. It provides specific guidance for bringing new and lasting value into the world. <p> The key ingredient to successful innovation is the everyday practice of Human-Centered Design: the discipline of developing solutions in the service of people. Every story of a good innovation--whether it's a new product, a new service, a new business model or a new form of governance-- begins and ends with people. It starts with careful discernment of human needs, and concludes with solutions that meet or exceed personal expectations. </p> <p> This handbook is your essential resource for innovation. It's a compact reference book describing thirty-six methods of Human-Centered Design, organized by way of three key design skills: </p> <p> </p> <p> - Looking: Methods for observing human experience </p> <p> - Understanding: Methods for analyzing challenges and opportunities </p> <p> - Making: Methods for envisioning future possibilities </p> <p> Each featured method includes a brief description; a pictorial example; a listing of benefits; a sampling of method combinations; and a quick guide with helpful hints for initial application. The full collection of methods is small enough to digest quickly, yet large enough to address myriad challenges. This book does not prescribe a formulaic innovation process. Rather, it introduces a versatile set of methods for practicing Human-Centered Design as a daily discipline in order to be more innovative and drive sustainable growth. </p> <p> Learn more at: luma-institute.com</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"}],"attributes":{"Author":"LUMA Institute","Binding":"Spiral-bound","Brand":"Brand: LUMA Institute","EAN":"9780985750909","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780985750909"},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"Used Book in Good Condition","ISBN":"0985750901","ItemDimensions":{"Weight":"60"},"Label":"LUMA Institute","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"LUMA Institute","MPN":"43192-388872","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"86","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"50","Length":"850","Weight":"60","Width":"650"},"PartNumber":"43192-388872","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"BOOKS_1973_AND_LATER","PublicationDate":"2012","Publisher":"LUMA Institute","Studio":"LUMA Institute","Title":"Innovating for People Handbook of Human-Centered Design Methods"}}}},{"id":"012375030X","data":{"width":64.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":5595,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$55.95"},"asin":"012375030X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=012375030X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=012375030X","salesRank":331471,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dYFJCSQAL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"129"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dYFJCSQAL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"403"},"title":"Designing with the Mind in Mind: Simple Guide to Understanding User Interface Design Rules","similar":["0470084111","1118766571","0201379376","0321965515","0321725522","0465050654","0123819598","0321767535","0321344758","0465051367"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=012375030X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A26Z&v=2&sig=We3auYnmY0LXHyAErXlyJWg9q%252FkIlkaYIige0Z6BmfU%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>Early user interface (UI) practitioners were trained in cognitive psychology, from which UI design rules were based.

Imagine how much it would help if there were a single perspective that you could use to simplify these complex issues down to a small set of objective principles. In <i>UI is Communication</i>, Everett McKay explains how to design intuitive user interfaces by focusing on effective human communication. A user interface is ultimately a conversation between users and technology. Well-designed user interfaces use the language of UI to communicate to users efficiently and naturally. They also recognize that there is an emotional human being at the other end of the interaction, so good user interfaces strive to make an emotional connection. Applying what you learn from <i>UI is Communication</i> will remove much of the mystique, subjectiveness, and complexity from user interface design, and help you make better design decisions with confidence.

Great brands execute their brands, elevating the brand from an external-facing message to a strategic tool for managing the business. They use their brand to shape their culture, focus their core operations, and design their customer experiences. This brand-as-business approach has proven to be far more effective than \"branding.\"</p> <p><b>What can stand in the way of implementing the brand-as-business approach?</b></p> <p>Some business leaders think of brands only in terms of messages and marketing tactics because that's all they know. Others want a quick fix and would rather change what they say about themselves rather than actually change. Still others understand the full business value of a brand but lack the tools and methods to realize it. <em>What Great Brands Do</em> will educate the first group, persuade the second, and equip the last.</p> <p><b>Why is rethinking our approach to brand-building so critical today?</b></p> <p>In practically every sector, competition is intensifying. Companies must differentiate themselves in substantive ways and deliver real value to customers. At the same time, those consumers are savvier than ever, and they're equipped with tools that enable them to see beneath a veneer that a company puts up. Image and reality must be closely aligned. Finally, advertising budgets are getting squeezed, but expectations for brand awareness and preference remain. The solution to all of these pressures is an integral brand strategy.</p> <p><b>Who needs to read this book?</b></p> <p><em>What Great Brands Do</em> is for CEOs, COOs, entrepreneurs, and other leaders—people who have the responsibility, and the desire, to grow their organizations. My book challenges the conventional rhetoric about brands and teaches the most essential brand-building principles and tools for running a better business.</p> </div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Marketing","id":"2702"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Denise Lee Yohn","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781118611258","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781118611258"},"Edition":"1","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"111861125X","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"880","Length":"590","Weight":"100","Width":"110"},"Label":"Jossey-Bass","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2799","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.99"},"Manufacturer":"Jossey-Bass","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"272","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"910","Weight":"100","Width":"610"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2014-01-07","Publisher":"Jossey-Bass","Studio":"Jossey-Bass","Title":"What Great Brands Do: The Seven Brand-Building Principles that Separate the Best from the Rest"}}}},{"id":"0735205396","data":{"width":51.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1863,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$18.63"},"asin":"0735205396","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Words-Science-Motivate-Influence/dp/0735205396?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735205396","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Words-Science-Motivate-Influence/dp/0735205396?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735205396","salesRank":74312,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WUU-H7UkL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"103"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WUU-H7UkL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"323"},"title":"Magic Words: The Science and Secrets Behind Seven Words That Motivate, Engage, and Influence","similar":["1119473454","1989025005","1946978108","0992816459","0321884507","1119418070","0998684813","1936891549","0807086029","1947814982"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0735205396&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A26Z&v=2&sig=afCrfFi%252FvhErPOkHNsVYTlfbiGv3qfYX%252FY5P5KQHTl0%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>\"An elegant and concise book.\" - NY Times</b><br> <br> Fans of Dr. Robert Cialdini, Daniel Pink, and Malcolm Gladwell will enjoy this in-depth look at the often surprising magic behind words.

In <i>Bulletproof Web Design, Third Edition</i>, bestselling author and web designer Dan Cederholm outlines standards-based strategies for building designs that can accommodate the myriad ways users choose to view the content. Each chapter starts out with an example of an unbulletproof approach--one that employs traditional HTML-based techniques--which Dan deconstructs, pointing out its limitations.

The fault, argues this fascinating, ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology.The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The book presents examples aplenty—among them, the VCR, computer, and office telephone, all models of how not to design for people.But good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. But the designer must care.The author is a world-famous psychologist and pioneer in the application of cognitive science. His aim is to raise the consciousness of both consumers and designers to the delights of products that are easy to use and understand.</Div></div>"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"With the many recent advances in technology, it seems, there has followed a diminution of quality. Electronic books have several advantages over their print counterparts, for instance. But for the time being, they're hard to use and unattractive to boot. Computers, which are supposed to make our lives easier, are commonly sources of frustration and wasted time. Movies are wondrously chock-a-block with special effects--but someone forgot the story. And so on.<p> Donald Norman, a retired professor of cognitive science, is bothered to no end by the fact that grappling with unfriendly objects now takes up so many of our hours. Over the course of several books, of which <I>The Psychology of Everyday Things</I> was the first, he has railed against bad design. He scrutinizes a range of artifacts that are supposed to make our daily living a little easier, and he finds most of them wanting. Why, he asks, does a door need instructions that say \"push\" or \"pull\"? A well-designed object, he argues, is self-explanatory. But well-designed objects are increasingly rare, for the present culture places a higher value on aesthetics than utility, even with such items as cordless screwdrivers, dresser drawers, and kitchen cabinets. In their concern for creating \"art,\" many designers don't seem to consider what people actually <i>do</i> with things. Such disregard, Norman suggests, leads to few objects being standardized: think of all the different kinds of unsynchronized clocks that lurk in microwave ovens, VCRs, coffee makers, and the like--and of all the different kinds of batteries needed to drive them. Why, he wonders, must we reset all those clocks whenever the power goes off? Some designer somewhere, he ventures, ought to develop a master clock that communicates with all other electric clocks in a home--one that, when reset, synchronizes its slave units.<p> You don't need to be especially interested in technological matters to enjoy Norman's arguments. The book's underlying question is aimed at a global audience: will the design of everyday things improve? If this entertaining and, yes, well-designed book changes even a few minds, perhaps it will. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Decorative Arts & Design","id":"336832011"},{"name":"Consumer Behavior","id":"2700"},{"name":"Psychology & Counseling","id":"11119"},{"name":"Ergonomics","id":"13755"},{"name":"Industrial Design","id":"13762"},{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","id":"573358"},{"name":"Cognitive","id":"15811861"},{"name":"General","id":"6511988011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Don Norman","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780465067091","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780465067091"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"0465067093","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"930","Length":"630","Weight":"130","Width":"62"},"Label":"Basic Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Basic Books","MPN":"illustrations","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"272","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"126","Length":"906","Weight":"115","Width":"622"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"illustrations","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1988-06-13","Publisher":"Basic Books","Studio":"Basic Books","Title":"The Psychology Of Everyday Things"}}}},{"id":"9063692846","data":{"width":60.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":3351,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$33.51"},"asin":"9063692846","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Convivial-Toolbox-Generative-Research-Design/dp/9063692846?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=9063692846","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Convivial-Toolbox-Generative-Research-Design/dp/9063692846?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=9063692846","salesRank":64370,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BiXWoWqGL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"121"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BiXWoWqGL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"379"},"title":"Convivial Toolbox: Generative Research for the Front End of Design","similar":["1592537561","1491927186","1631593749","1491923539","1933820330","1118083466","1118156307","9063693532","1939727065","193382011X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=9063692846&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A28Z&v=2&sig=aRUTfSfgZMWpwbrWQS8x12jmnFL6zE5goapd1m%252BGKFI%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><p>Generative design research is an approach to bring the people we serve through design directly into the design process in order to ensure that we can meet their needs and dreams for the future.

Norman builds on this critique to offer a consumer-oriented theory of natural human-machine interaction that can be put into practice by the engineers and industrial designers of tomorrow's thinking machines.

To function as a language that reliably conveys meaning, visual language must embody codes that normalize its practices among both the designers who employ it and the readers who interpret it. </P><P>In this wide-ranging analysis, Charles Kostelnick and Michael Hassett demonstrate how visual language in professional communication―text design, data displays, illustrations―is shaped by conventional practices that are invented, codified, and modified by users in visual discourse communities. Drawing on rhetorical theory, design studies, and a broad array of historical and contemporary examples, <I>Shaping Information: The Rhetoric of Visual Conventions</I> explores the processes by which conventions evolve and proliferate and shows how conventions serve as the medium that designers use to shape, stabilize, and streamline visual information. </P><P>Kostelnick and Hassett extend contemporary theories that define rhetoric as a social act, arguing that visual conventions also thrive within discourse communities and are fragile forms that vary widely in their longevity and scope. <I>Shaping Information: The Rhetoric of Visual Conventions</I> is a thorough guide for scholars, teachers and practitioners of rhetoric and business and technical communication and for

use, sexy, and consumable. In <I>Speculative Everything</I>, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby propose a kind of design that is used as a tool to create not only things but ideas. For them, design is a means of speculating about how things could be―to imagine possible futures. This is not the usual sort of predicting or forecasting, spotting trends and extrapolating; these kinds of predictions have been proven wrong, again and again. Instead, Dunne and Raby pose “what if” questions that are intended to open debate and discussion about the kind of future people want (and do not want).</P><P><I>Speculative Everything</I> offers a tour through an emerging cultural landscape of design ideas, ideals, and approaches. Dunne and Raby cite examples from their own design and teaching and from other projects from fine art, design, architecture, cinema, and photography. They also draw on futurology, political theory, the philosophy of technology, and literary fiction. They show us, for example, ideas for a solar kitchen restaurant; a flypaper robotic clock; a menstruation machine; a cloud-seeding truck; a phantom-limb sensation recorder; and devices for food foraging that use the tools of synthetic biology. Dunne and Raby contend that if we speculate more―about everything―reality will become more malleable.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress—to measure what mattered.<br><br>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove (\"the greatest manager of his or any era\") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.<br><br>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization. <br><br>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention.<br><br>In <i>Measure What Matters</i>, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. This book will help a new generation of leaders capture the same magic."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Workplace Culture","id":"2571"},{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategy & Competition","id":"2553"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"John Doerr","Binding":"Hardcover","Creator":"Larry Page","EAN":"9780525536222","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780525536222"},"ISBN":"0525536221","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"580","Weight":"95","Width":"100"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","MPN":"43192-806097","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"320","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"830","Weight":"95","Width":"560"},"PartNumber":"43192-806097","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-04-24","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2018-04-24","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs"}}}},{"id":"0321205685","data":{"width":60.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":4231,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$42.31"},"asin":"0321205685","link":"https://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Software-Development/dp/0321205685?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321205685","url":"https://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Software-Development/dp/0321205685?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321205685","salesRank":49987,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mjTqI18WL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"121"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mjTqI18WL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"379"},"title":"User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development","similar":["0131479415","0321579364","0321637704","1491904909","0321605780","0137043295","0977616649","0993088104","0321534468","0201702258"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0321205685&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-21T16%3A42%3A31Z&v=2&sig=g4dl94XZM1BnYAkGC3mJzGBD%252FRERk5Rg2n%252BE%252BAWmUuA%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>Thoroughly reviewed and eagerly anticipated by the agile community, <i>User Stories Applied</i> offers a requirements process that saves time, eliminates rework, and leads directly to better software. </p> <p>The best way to build software that meets users' needs is to begin with \"user stories\": simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality that will be valuable to real users.

Above all, this book will help you achieve the promise of agile and iterative delivery: to ensure that the right stuff gets delivered through productive discussions between delivery team members and business stakeholders. Who is this book for? This is a book for anyone working in an iterative delivery environment, doing planning with user stories. The ideas in this book are useful both to people relatively new to user stories and those who have been working with them for years. People who work in software delivery, regardless of their role, will find plenty of tips for engaging stakeholders better and structuring iterative plans more effectively. Business stakeholders working with software teams will discover how to provide better information to their delivery groups, how to set better priorities and how to outrun the competition by achieving more with less software. What's inside? Unsurprisingly, the book contains exactly fifty ideas. They are grouped into five major parts: - Creating stories: This part deals with capturing information about stories before they get accepted into the delivery pipeline. You'll find ideas about what kind of information to note down on story cards and how to quickly spot potential problems. - Planning with stories: This part contains ideas that will help you manage the big-picture view, set milestones and organise long-term work. - Discussing stories: User stories are all about effective conversations, and this part contains ideas to improve discussions between delivery teams and business stakeholders. You'll find out how to discover hidden assumptions and how to facilitate effective conversations to ensure shared understanding. - Splitting stories: The ideas in this part will help you deal with large and difficult stories, offering several strategies for dividing them into smaller chunks that will help you learn fast and deliver value quickly. - Managing iterative delivery: This part contains ideas that will help you work with user stories in the short and mid term, manage capacity, prioritise and reduce scope to achieve the most with the least software.

The result is a tremendous amount of time and money wasted due to wrong assumptions, lack of focus, poor communication of objectives, lack of understanding and misalignment with overall goals. There has to be a better way to deliver! This handbook is a practical guide to impact mapping, a simple yet incredibly effective method for collaborative strategic planning that helps organisations make an impact with software. Impact mapping helps to create better plans and roadmaps that ensure alignment of business and delivery, and are easily adaptable to change. Impact mapping fits nicely into several current trends in software product management and release planning, including goal-oriented requirements engineering, frequent iterative delivery, agile and lean software methods, lean startup product development cycles, and design thinking.

Where do you start? What do you need to know? What are your real job responsibilities? If you don’t have a job description or it doesn’t seem to fit (or if you never really looked at it), you’ll need to come up with one for yourself that goes beyond a list of projects or hiring a team. That’s where this book comes in. It’s designed to be a tactical guide for you, the person charged with leading innovation, regardless of the product or domain, no matter the organizational structure you’ve inherited or are meant to create, no matter the process you’ve adopted or want to adopt, whether you work in a brand-new start up or a Fortune 500 corporation. It’s for managers and consultants, design directors and chief innovation officers, board members, CEOs, and recruiters. It will help you juggle the needs of your team, your organization, and the projects, products, or services themselves.
