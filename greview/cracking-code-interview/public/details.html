<h5>Personal Opinion</h5>
<p>
  Professional musicians practice their skills regularly. I think professional prorammers should do the same.

  is amazing practice book. Regardless whether you are looking for a new job or not. 
</p>
<p>This book should be in a library of every software engineer, and it should be in active use.
  Contrary to popular belief that in day-to-day job we don't encounter problems like those in the book,
  I believe these problems are abundant. We just haven't learned to recognize them. This book will teach
  you to spot them.

<h5>Key Observations</h5>

<p>
  I find this map remarkable, because despite of the fact that it was generated procedurally,
  the map aligns with what I personally believe constitues a professional developer.
