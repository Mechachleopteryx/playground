Computational Fairy Tales introduces principles of computational thinking, illustrating high-level computer science concepts, the motivation behind them, and their application in a non-computer—fairy tale—domain. The goal of this book is not to provide comprehensive coverage of each topic, but rather to provide a high level overview of the breadth and excitement of computer science. It’s a quest that will take you from learning the basics of programming in a blacksmith’s forge to fighting curses with recursion. Fifteen seers delivered the same prophecy, without so much as a single minstrel to lighten the mood: an unknown darkness threatens the kingdom.

What is it used for and how does it fit within the broader arena of machine learning?</p> <p>we gently explore these topics so that we can be prepared to dive deep further on. To start, we’ll begin with a high-level overview of machine learning and then drill down into the specifics of a neural network.</p> <h2>The Math of Neural Networks</h2> <p>On a high level, a network learns just like we do, through trial and error. This is true regardless if the network is supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised. Once we dig a bit deeper though, we discover that a handful of mathematical functions play a major role in the trial and error process. It also becomes clear that a grasp of the underlying mathematics helps clarify how a network learns.</p> * Forward Propagation * Calculating The Total Error * Calculating The Gradients * Updating The Weights <h2>Make Your Own Artificial Neural Network: Hands on Example</h2> <p>You will learn to build a simple neural network using all the concepts and functions we learned in the previous few chapters. Our example will be basic but hopefully very intuitive. Many examples available online are either hopelessly abstract or make use of the same data sets, which can be repetitive. Our goal is to be crystal clear and engaging, but with a touch of fun and uniqueness. This section contains the following eight chapters.</p> <h2>Building Neural Networks in Python</h2> <p>There are many ways to build a neural network and lots of tools to get the job done. This is fantastic, but it can also be overwhelming when you start, because there are so many tools to choose from. We are going to take a look at what tools are needed and help you nail down the essentials. To build a neural network</p> <h3>Tensorflow and Neural Networks</h3> <p>There is no single way to build a feedforward neural network with Python, and that is especially true if you throw Tensorflow into the mix. However, there is a general framework that exists that can be divided into five steps and grouped into two parts. We are going to briefly explore these five steps so that we are prepared to use them to build a network later on. Ready? Let’s begin.</p> <h3>Neural Network: Distinguish Handwriting</h3> <p>We are going to dig deep with Tensorflow and build a neural network that can distinguish between handwritten numbers. We’ll use the same 5 steps we covered in the high-level overview, and we are going to take time exploring each line of code.</p> <h3>Neural Network: Classify Images</h3> <p>10 minutes. That’s all it takes to build an image classifier thanks to Google! We will provide a high-level overview of how to classify images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Google’s Inception V3 model. Once finished, you will be able to tweak this code to classify any type of image sets! Cats, bats, super heroes - the sky’s the limit.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Neural Networks","id":"3896"},{"name":"Graphics & Design","id":"4134"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Michael Taylor","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Independently published","EAN":"9781549869136","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781549869136"},"IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1549869132","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"62"},"Label":"Independently published","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1099","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$10.99"},"Manufacturer":"Independently published","NumberOfPages":"248","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"62","Length":"900","Weight":"96","Width":"600"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-10-04","Publisher":"Independently published","Studio":"Independently published","Title":"Make Your Own Neural Network: An In-depth Visual Introduction For Beginners"}}}},{"id":"1549893645","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":899,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$8.99"},"asin":"1549893645","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Math-Neural-Networks-Michael-Taylor/dp/1549893645?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1549893645","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Math-Neural-Networks-Michael-Taylor/dp/1549893645?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1549893645","salesRank":274228,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hyUeRJHVL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hyUeRJHVL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"The Math of Neural Networks","similar":["1549869132","1549761749","1549893750","1549617214","1981614060","1530826608","0999282905","1491962291","152095140X","1723484725"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1549893645&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-25T01%3A05%3A43Z&v=2&sig=EK9j%252FZcTUGoYJuLCWojoKDmmJXC%252Bd8noJSZOW4V0eCY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"There are many reasons why neural networks fascinate us and have captivated headlines in recent years.

It is also about Python. However, there is much more. The study of algorithms and data structures is central to understanding what computer science is all about. Learning computer science is not unlike learning any other type of difficult subject matter. The only way to be successful is through deliberate and incremental exposure to the fundamental ideas. A beginning computer scientist needs practice so that there is a thorough understanding before continuing on to the more complex parts of the curriculum. In addition, a beginner needs to be given the opportunity to be successful and gain confidence. This textbook is designed to serve as a text for a first course on data structures and algorithms, typically taught as the second course in the computer science curriculum. Even though the second course is considered more advanced than the first course, this book assumes you are beginners at this level. You may still be struggling with some of the basic ideas and skills from a first computer science course and yet be ready to further explore the discipline and continue to practice problem solving. We cover abstract data types and data structures, writing algorithms, and solving problems. We look at a number of data structures and solve classic problems that arise. The tools and techniques that you learn here will be applied over and over as you continue your study of computer science."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Computer Science","id":"3508"},{"name":"Data Structures","id":"132570011"},{"name":"Python","id":"285856"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Bradley N.

Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge.<br><br>You'll also learn how to:<br>–Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve<br>–Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries<br>–Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job<br>–Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory<br>–Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems<br><br>Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative art—and the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to <i>Think Like a Programmer</i>."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<h3>A Message From Author V. Anton Spraul</h3> <p>“Over the past 15 years, I've taught programming to countless students from every sort of background. A few of them were naturals, but most struggled, even the ones who would eventually turn into excellent programmers. However, they weren't struggling with the syntax of the programming language, but rather with applying it to solve the assigned problems.</p> <p>Knowing how to read a program is very different from knowing how to write one. While typical books or training courses are often effective at explaining the individual elements of programming, they tend to offer little advice on combining these elements to solve particular problems. That's where <i>Think Like a Programmer</i> comes in.”</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Memory Management","id":"3882"},{"name":"Software Development","id":"4016"},{"name":"Tutorials","id":"3966"},{"name":"C++","id":"9045760011"},{"name":"Algorithms","id":"491298"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"},{"name":"Software Design & Engineering","id":"491316"}],"attributes":{"Author":"V.

Great programmers practice to keep their skills sharp. Get sharp and stay sharp with more than fifty practice exercises rooted in real-world scenarios. If you're a new programmer, these challenges will help you learn what you need to break into the field, and if you're a seasoned pro, you can use these exercises to learn that hot new language for your next gig.</p><p>One of the best ways to learn a programming language is to use it to solve problems. That's what this book is all about. Instead of questions rooted in theory, this book presents problems you'll encounter in everyday software development. These problems are designed for people learning their first programming language, and they also provide a learning path for experienced developers to learn a new language quickly.</p><p>Start with simple input and output programs. Do some currency conversion and figure out how many months it takes to pay off a credit card. Calculate blood alcohol content and determine if it's safe to drive. Replace words in files and filter records, and use web services to display the weather, store data, and show how many people are in space right now. At the end you'll tackle a few larger programs that will help you bring everything together.</p><p>Each problem includes constraints and challenges to push you further, but it's up to you to come up with the solutions. And next year, when you want to learn a new programming language or style of programming (perhaps OOP vs. functional), you can work through this book again, using new approaches to solve familiar problems.<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b><br/><br/>You need access to a computer, a programming language reference, and the programming language you want to use.</p></div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Algorithms","id":"3870"},{"name":"Software Development","id":"4016"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"3952"},{"name":"Software Design & Engineering","id":"491316"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Brian P.

It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.</p><p>Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception. </p><p>Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.</p><p>You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.</p><p>You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy</p><h4>What You Will Learn</h4><ul><li>Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods</li><li>Separate related objects into a taxonomy of classes and describe the properties and behaviors of those objects via the class interface</li><li>Extend class functionality using inheritance</li><li>Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them</li><li>Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python</li><li>Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python</li><li>Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3</li><li>Exploit object-oriented programming in key Python technologies such as Kivy and Django.</li><li>Object-oriented programming concurrently with asyncio</li></ul><h4>Table of Contents</h4><ol><li>Object-oriented Design</li><li>Objects in Python</li><li>When Objects Are Alike</li><li>Expecting the Unexpected</li><li>When to Use Object-oriented Programming</li><li>Python Data Structures</li><li>Python Object-oriented Shortcuts</li><li>Strings and Serialization</li><li>The Iterator Pattern</li><li>Python Design Patterns I</li><li>Python Design Patterns II</li><li>Testing Object-oriented Programs</li><li>Concurrency</li></ol>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Object-Oriented Design","id":"4013"},{"name":"Python","id":"285856"},{"name":"Object-Oriented Software Design","id":"491310"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Dusty Phillips","Binding":"Paperback","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"1784398780"},"EAN":"9781784398781","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781784398781"},"Edition":"2","ISBN":"1784398780","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"750","Weight":"173","Width":"104"},"Label":"Packt Publishing - ebooks Account","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"4999","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$49.99"},"Manufacturer":"Packt Publishing - ebooks Account","MPN":"black & white illustrations","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"460","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"110","Length":"925","Weight":"212","Width":"748"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"black & white illustrations","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2015-08-20","Publisher":"Packt Publishing - ebooks Account","ReleaseDate":"2015-08-20","Studio":"Packt Publishing - ebooks Account","Title":"Python 3 Object-oriented Programming - Second Edition: Building robust and maintainable software with object oriented design patterns in Python"}}}},{"id":"1848000693","data":{"width":57.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":4051,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$40.51"},"asin":"1848000693","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1848000693","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1848000693","salesRank":41600,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515GcxK1FFL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"115"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515GcxK1FFL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"359"},"title":"The Algorithm Design Manual","similar":["0262033844","0984782850","0201657880","032157351X","111941847X","069116407X","1517671272","1617292230","0201558025","1537713949"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1848000693&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-25T01%3A05%3A35Z&v=2&sig=%252Bpbo9Je18QEYRyHmdzAEkEpt8CH2x2rvOl81Y87fDUM%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>This newly expanded and updated second edition of the best-selling classic continues to take the \"mystery\" out of designing algorithms, and analyzing their efficacy and efficiency.

The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices.

Jon has done a wonderful job of updating the material. I am very impressed at how fresh the new examples seem. - Steve McConnell When programmers list their favorite books, Jon Bentley's collection of programming pearls is commonly included among the classics. Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley's pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience. In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"Fourteen years after it was first issued, C++ expert Jon Bentley reinvents a true classic with the second edition of his <I>Programming Pearls</I>. Completely revised and brought up to date with all new code examples in C and C++, this book remains an exceptional tutorial for learning to <I>think</I> like a programmer. <p> The \"pearls\" in question center not only on choosing the right algorithms (like binary searches, sorting techniques, or sparse arrays) but also on showing how to solve problems effectively. Each chapter frames a particular programming task--such as sorting numbers, creating anagrams, or counting the words in a block of text--many drawn from Bentley's experiences in his long career as a developer. The book traces the process of arriving at a fast, efficient, and accurate solution, along with code profiling to discover what works best. After refining the correct answer, each chapter enumerates programming principles that you can use on your own.<p> The author also challenges you to think like an engineer, and each chapter ends with about a dozen problems to get you thinking creatively about design issues. (Sidebars on such historical topics as the first computer solutions to computer chess, spell-checking, and even architectural design help create a perspective on successful problem solving and make for a truly educational and enjoyable tour of how to become a better programmer.) Bentley also asks the reader to think analytically about the world with \"back of the envelope\" estimation techniques drawn from engineering. Appendices list the algorithms and code rules covered in the book, plus some sample solutions.<p> Fans of the first edition of this title will be pleased to see this favorite computer text brought up to date for today's faster hardware. Whether you want to improve your command of algorithms or test your problem-solving skills, the new version of <I>Programming Pearl</I> is a challenging, instructive, and thoroughly entertaining resource. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Programming and problem-solving tutorial, sorting algorithms, merge sort, bit vectors, binary searches, program correctness and testing, improving performance, engineering and problem-solving techniques, performance estimates, designing for safety, divide-and-conquer and scanning algorithms, tuning code, tips for more efficient memory usage, insertion sort, quicksort algorithms, sparse arrays, searching algorithms, binary search trees, heaps, priority queues, searching text, and generating random text."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Software Development","id":"4016"},{"name":"Software","id":"4053"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jon Bentley","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Bentley, Jon Louis","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"AL07964085"},"EAN":"9780201657883","EANList":{"EANListElement":["0785342657883","8601400000656","8601419379347","9780201657883"]},"Edition":"2","Feature":"Addison-Wesley Professional","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0201657880","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"920","Length":"620","Weight":"80","Width":"70"},"Label":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"4499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$44.99"},"Manufacturer":"Addison-Wesley Professional","MPN":"9780201657883","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"256","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"50","Length":"910","Weight":"80","Width":"620"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780201657883","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1999-10-07","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","ReleaseDate":"1999-09-27","Studio":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Title":"Programming Pearls (2nd Edition)","TradeInValue":{"Amount":"672","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$6.72"},"UPC":"785342657883","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"785342657883"}}}}},{"id":"0134685997","data":{"width":64.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2980,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$29.80"},"asin":"0134685997","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0134685997","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0134685997","salesRank":5297,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51C2-oWryCL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"129"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51C2-oWryCL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"404"},"title":"Effective Java (3rd Edition)","similar":["0321349601","0596007124","0132350882","0201633612","1259589331","1259589315","1517671272","0262529076","0131872486","1449373321"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0134685997&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-25T01%3A05%3A35Z&v=2&sig=BTkA5cAK0SQ0T3ckAY6eFcR8%252B%252B0uH0Ateh1MajUpMds%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p style=\"margin:0px;\"> <b>The Definitive Guide to Java Platform Best Practices–Updated for Java 7, 8, and 9</b> </p> <p style=\"margin:0px;\"> </p> <p style=\"margin:0px;\">Java has changed dramatically since the previous edition of <i>Effective Java</i> was published shortly after the release of Java 6.

However, Python has unique strengths, charms, and expressivity that can be hard to grasp at first -- as well as hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up if you aren't aware of them. <b>Effective Python</b> will help you harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code. Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling <i>Effective C++</i>, Brett Slatkin brings together 59 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and realistic code examples from expert programmers.<br> <br>Through realistic examples, Slatkin uncovers little-known Python quirks, intricacies, and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You'll learn how to choose the most efficient and effective way to accomplish key tasks when multiple options exist, and how to write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and improve.<br> <br>Drawing on his deep understanding of Python's capabilities, Slatkin offers practical advice for each major area of development with both Python 3.x and Python 2.x. Coverage includes:<br> <ul> <li>Algorithms</li> <li>Objects</li> <li>Concurrency</li> <li>Collaboration</li> <li>Built-in modules</li> <li>Production techniques</li> <li>And more</li> </ul> Each section contains specific, actionable guidelines organized into items, each with carefully worded advice supported by detailed technical arguments and illuminating examples. Using <b>Effective Python</b>, you can systematically improve all the Python code you write: not by blindly following rules or mimicking incomprehensible idioms, but by gaining a deep understanding of the technical reasons why they make sense."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Python","id":"285856"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Brett Slatkin","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Addison-Wesley Professional","EAN":"9780134034287","EANList":{"EANListElement":["0884807658059","9780134034287"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Addison-Wesley Professional","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0134034287","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"910","Length":"700","Weight":"0","Width":"80"},"Label":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3999","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$39.99"},"Manufacturer":"Addison-Wesley Professional","MPN":"9780134034287","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"256","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"60","Length":"900","Weight":"105","Width":"690"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780134034287","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2015-03-08","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Studio":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Title":"Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python (Effective Software Development Series)","UPC":"884807658059","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"884807658059"}}}}},{"id":"812656217X","data":{"width":62,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2002,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$20.02"},"asin":"812656217X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/812656217X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=812656217X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/812656217X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=812656217X","salesRank":112281,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51I8HdkIM4L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"124"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51I8HdkIM4L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"386"},"title":"Data Structures and Algorithms in Python","similar":["1537713949","1983861189","1590282574","1617292230","1593270038","1449359361","0984782850","0999282921","111941847X","0134034287"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=812656217X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-25T01%3A05%3A35Z&v=2&sig=V9IQbKLK0XJcytKwSHqt4gnNDyyJM%252BoK1KLfzARuOMA%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Paperback International Edition ...

Several new topics have been added, and the most significant ideas have been traced to their historical roots. The book includes more than 500 exercises, divided into six categories. Complete answers are provided for all exercises, except research problems, making the book particularly valuable for self-study.</p> <p style=\"margin:0px;\">Major topics include:</p> <ul> <li>Sums</li> <li>Recurrences</li> <li>Integer functions</li> <li>Elementary number theory</li> <li>Binomial coefficients</li> <li>Generating functions</li> <li>Discrete probability</li> <li>Asymptotic methods</li> </ul> <p style=\"margin:0px;\">This second edition includes important new material about mechanical summation.

In <I>Once Upon an Algorithm</I>, Martin Erwig explains computation as something that takes place beyond electronic computers, and computer science as the study of systematic problem solving. Erwig points out that many daily activities involve problem solving. Getting up in the morning, for example: You get up, take a shower, get dressed, eat breakfast. This simple daily routine solves a recurring problem through a series of well-defined steps. In computer science, such a routine is called an algorithm.</P><P>Erwig illustrates a series of concepts in computing with examples from daily life and familiar stories.

The movie <I>Groundhog Day </I>illustrates the problem of unsolvability; Sherlock Holmes manipulates data structures when solving a crime; the magic in Harry Potter's world is understood through types and abstraction; and Indiana Jones demonstrates the complexity of searching. Along the way, Erwig also discusses representations and different ways to organize data; “intractable” problems; language, syntax, and ambiguity; control structures, loops, and the halting problem; different forms of recursion; and rules for finding errors in algorithms.</P><P>This engaging book explains computation accessibly and shows its relevance to daily life.

Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn't taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In <I>The Pragmatic Programmer</I>, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they've discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code.<p> Some of the authors' nuggets of pragmatism are concrete, and the path to their implementation is clear. They advise readers to learn one text editor, for example, and use it for everything. They also recommend the use of version-tracking software for even the smallest projects, and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a text-manipulation language. Other (perhaps more valuable) advice is more light-hearted. In the debugging section, it is noted that, \"if you see hoof prints think horses, not zebras.\" That is, suspect everything, but start looking for problems in the most obvious places. There are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense, and for integrating testing into the development process. You'll want a copy of <I>The Pragmatic Programmer</I> for two reasons: it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered. Working programmers will enjoy this book. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: A useful approach to software design and construction that allows for efficient, profitable development of high-quality products.

But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.<br> <br>Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with <i> <b>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</b> </i>. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.<br> <br>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it.

The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.<br> <br>Readers will come away from this book understanding<br> <ul> <li>How to tell the difference between good and bad code</li> <li>How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code</li> <li>How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes</li> <li>How to format code for maximum readability</li> <li>How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic</li> <li>How to unit test and practice test-driven development</li> </ul>This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.<br> <br>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Software Development","id":"4016"},{"name":"Testing","id":"4133"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"3952"},{"name":"Software Design & Engineering","id":"491316"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Robert C.

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study.<br /><br /> The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows.<br /><br /> And that's how your brain will learn Java. <em>Head First Java</em> combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever.<br /><br /> If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.<br /><br /> By exploiting how your brain works, <em>Head First Java</em> compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book.

This book shows readers how to use the Java platforms threading model more precisely by helping them to understand the patterns and tradeoffs associated with concurrent programming. You will learn how to initiate, control, and coordinate concurrent activities using the class java.lang.Thread, the keywords synchronized and volatile, and the methods wait, notify, and notifyAll.

Written for the advanced Java developer, this book offers a comprehensive tour of leading-edge thinking about parallel coding processes.<p> Within the dozens of techniques and tips offered here, this book accomplishes at least two goals. First, it shows how concurrency is implemented by default within Java, with material on how built-in features (like the <I>synchronized</I> keyword and its memory model) can be expected to perform when dealing with multiple threads. Naturally, Java threads themselves are also covered, including priorities, scheduling, and the like. <p> Much of this book looks at ways to improve performance of concurrent code beyond the simple default strategies. After defining criteria for measuring concurrent code (such as safety and \"liveness,\" a measure of running live threads effectively), the book presents dozens of techniques for letting threads work together safely. For the working Java programmer, coverage of patterns that have been implemented in the downloadable <I>java.concurrency</I> package will be the most immediately useful. (Within this nearly encyclopedic survey, short code snippets are used for every pattern and concept.) <p>Though theoretical at times, this book offers plenty of ideas and sample code to get you started thinking of ways to improve multithreaded code. <p> Impressively comprehensive, <I>Concurrent Programming in Java</I> offers a veritable bible of techniques for doing two things at once with threads in Java. It's a worthwhile guide to the state-of-the-art strategies for improving the performance of your Java threads. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Threads and concurrency in Java, design considerations (safety, liveness, and performance), Before/After Patterns, layering, adapters, immutability and synchronization, deadlock, resource ordering, the Java Memory Model and concurrency, using the <I>java.concurrency</I> package, confinement, refactoring for concurrency, mutexes, read-write locks, recovering from failure, notifications, semaphores, latches, exchanges, transactions, one-way messages, worker threads, polling and event-driven I/O, parallelism techniques (fork/join, computation trees, and barriers), Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Programming","id":"3839"},{"name":"Software","id":"4053"},{"name":"Java","id":"3608"},{"name":"Mathematics","id":"13884"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Doug Lea","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780201310092","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780201310092","0785342310092"]},"Edition":"2","ISBN":"0201310090","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"890","Length":"730","Weight":"146","Width":"110"},"Label":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"7499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$74.99"},"Manufacturer":"Addison-Wesley Professional","MPN":"Illustrations","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"432","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"94","Length":"913","Weight":"163","Width":"740"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"Illustrations","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1999-11-04","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","ReleaseDate":"1999-10-25","Studio":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Title":"Concurrent Programming in Java™: Design Principles and Pattern, 2nd Edition","UPC":"785342310092","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"785342310092"}}}}},{"id":"0137081073","data":{"width":61.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1688,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.88"},"asin":"0137081073","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0137081073","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0137081073","salesRank":15049,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qREOc85qL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"123"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qREOc85qL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"383"},"title":"The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers","similar":["0132350882","0134494164","020161622X","0321146530","0735619670","0134052501","0131177052","0201633612","0321127420","0134685997"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0137081073&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-25T01%3A05%3A38Z&v=2&sig=%252BIAZB4xuXFc%252FoyXKI%252FRJnGuA%252BLNcirNsdplfwVGzSBk%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\">Programmers who endure and succeed amidst swirling uncertainty and nonstop pressure share a common attribute: They care deeply about the practice of creating software.

In these cases, a curriculum that is rigorous and demonstrates strong quantitative and analytical skills will prove useful. Economics, statistics, and physics are three great choices. <br/><br/> <b>What can you do outside of work to make yourself stand out? </b><br/> One of the strongest things a candidate can do is something that shows initiative or leadership. Imagine a candidate who tutors under-privileged children on the side. That's a wonderful thing to do. But, the candidate who launched their own tutoring program and built up a team of twenty fellow tutors will have a much stronger application. Your efforts need not be \"feel goody,\" though. Entrepreneurial endeavors are greatly respected, and can earn you a bit of cash too. <br/><br/> <b>How do you perform well at work -- and have it show in your next application? </b><br/> The key here is to think about your application well before you're writing it, as your entire job will be boiled down to just a few bullet points. Seek out projects that will lend themselves to short, concrete, understandable bullet points. Projects with an external impact are often ideal. Remember that while revamping some internal system may have an enormous impact on your company, the impact is usually unclear to those outside the company. <br/><br/> <b>How should you design your resume? </b><br/> Make it short and sweet. Remember that people don't really \"read\" resumes - they glance. Your resume should be bulleted (no bulky paragraphs) with specific, tangible accomplishments. And stick to one page, or two pages if absolutely necessary and only if you have more than ten years of experience. <br/><br/> <b>How much technical expertise do you need? </b><br/> Outside of engineering, truly technical (i.e., coding) experience isn't necessary, though it's certainly nice to have and can set you apart. What's more important is to be able to demonstrate knowledge of and passion for technology. You should understand how the big and the small companies are shaping the tech field, and how trends like cloud computing, security, and mobile technologies are affect businesses and consumers. <br/><br/> <b>How should you prep for the interview? </b><br/> Interview preparation should include a mix of company research, skill-based preparation and resume preparation. The latter is especially important, and often overlooked. You need to prepare for specific questions on every \"project\" on your resume. One way to ensure that you have good coverage of the key questions is by diagramming your Interview Preparation Grid, as discussed in the The Google Resume. Thorough preparation will give you a big leg up on other candidates! <br/>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Guides","id":"2575"},{"name":"Job Hunting","id":"2576"},{"name":"Computers & Technology","id":"886498"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Gayle Laakmann McDowell","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780470927625","EANList":{"EANListElement":["0884577383816","9780470927625"]},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"0470927623","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"880","Length":"580","Weight":"75","Width":"100"},"Label":"Wiley","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2295","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$22.95"},"Manufacturer":"Wiley","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"288","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"110","Length":"850","Weight":"75","Width":"590"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2011-03-01","Publisher":"Wiley","Studio":"Wiley","Title":"The Google Resume: How to Prepare for a Career and Land a Job at Apple, Microsoft, Google, or any Top Tech Company","UPC":"884577383816","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"884577383816"}}}}},{"id":"0316099988","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":998,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$9.98"},"asin":"0316099988","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Are-Smart-Enough-Work-Google/dp/0316099988?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316099988","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Are-Smart-Enough-Work-Google/dp/0316099988?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316099988","salesRank":89376,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EhJ1VVfgL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EhJ1VVfgL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"324"},"title":"Are You Smart Enough to Work at Google?: Trick Questions, Zen-like Riddles, Insanely Difficult Puzzles, and Other Devious Interviewing Techniques You ...

The chapter structure will return to a more linear presentation of software engineering topics with a direct emphasis on the major activities that are part of a generic software process. Content will focus on widely used software engineering methods and will de-emphasize or completely eliminate discussion of secondary methods, tools and techniques. The intent is to provide a more targeted, prescriptive, and focused approach, while attempting to maintain SEPA's reputation as a comprehensive guide to software engineering. The 39 chapters of this edition are organized into five parts - Process, Modeling, Quality Management, Managing Software Projects, and Advanced Topics.

Starting from simple building blocks, computer algorithms enable machines to recognize and produce speech, translate texts, categorize and summarize documents, describe images, and predict the weather. A task that would take hours can be completed in virtually no time by using a few lines of code in a modern scripting program.

Readers should be comfortable with mathematical fundamentals and have a basic understanding of how computers work; all other necessary concepts are explained in the text. After presenting background in pseudocode conventions, basic terminology, and data structures, chapters cover compression, cryptography, graphs, searching and sorting, hashing, classification, strings, and chance.

With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, <I>The Elements of Computing Systems</I> gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as its comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system.</P><P>Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture.</P><P>Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience.</P><P>The book's web site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs for the twelve projects. The projects and systems can be modified to meet various teaching needs, and all the supplied software is open-source.</P>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Computer Science","id":"3508"},{"name":"Design & Architecture","id":"132555011"},{"name":"PCs","id":"69774"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Noam Nisan","Shimon Schocken"],"Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"MIT Press MA","EAN":"9780262640688","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601300171777","9780262640688"]},"Feature":"MIT Press MA","ISBN":"0262640686","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"800","Weight":"123","Width":"69"},"Label":"The MIT Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3200","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$32.00"},"Manufacturer":"The MIT Press","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"344","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"87","Length":"913","Weight":"123","Width":"811"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2005-03-31","Publisher":"The MIT Press","ReleaseDate":"2008-01-25","Studio":"The MIT Press","Title":"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"}}}},{"id":"0692106715","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1139,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$11.39"},"asin":"0692106715","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Principles-Foundational-Concepts/dp/0692106715?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0692106715","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Principles-Foundational-Concepts/dp/0692106715?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0692106715","salesRank":26311,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510ksOQGlwL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510ksOQGlwL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Computer Science Principles: The Foundational Concepts of Computer Science - For AP Computer Science Principles","similar":["1260019993","0738612340","1438009194","1521137455","0997316020","1260010333","0137135599","1934780472","0691158193","0262036630"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0692106715&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-25T01%3A05%3A43Z&v=2&sig=8xgGydUq%252F9LWanH4sQcLftMBd75%252BZw1zNG9TzrTUn9M%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Computer science is the world's fastest growing field of study, and this growth is showing no signs of slowing down.

Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace.

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.

Today refactoring requires considerable design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be able to improve their code using refactoring techniques.<p> Besides an introduction to refactoring, this handbook provides a catalog of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about <I>Refactoring</I> is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip is presented with a simple name, a \"motivation,\" and examples using Java and UML.) <p> Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring. (When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After the discussion on how to detect the \"smell\" of bad code, readers get to the heart of the book, its catalog of over 70 \"refactorings\"--tips for better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with \"before\" and \"after\" code, along with an explanation. Later chapters provide a quick look at refactoring research.<p> Like software patterns, refactoring may be an idea whose time has come. This groundbreaking title will surely help bring refactoring to the programming mainstream. With its clear advice on a hot new topic, <I>Refactoring</I> is sure to be essential reading for anyone who writes or maintains object-oriented software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p><B>Topics Covered:</B> Refactoring, improving software code, redesign, design tips, patterns, unit testing, refactoring research, and tools."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Object-Oriented Design","id":"4013"},{"name":"Software","id":"4053"},{"name":"Foreign Language Study & Reference","id":"11773"},{"name":"Object-Oriented Software Design","id":"491310"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"491314"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Martin Fowler","Kent Beck","John Brant","William Opdyke","Don Roberts"],"Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Color":"Cream","Creator":"Erich Gamma","EAN":"9780201485677","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780201485677","8601300152660","8601404267451","0785342485677"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Addison-Wesley Professional","ISBN":"0201485672","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"920","Length":"750","Weight":"198","Width":"120"},"Label":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"6499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$64.99"},"Manufacturer":"Addison-Wesley Professional","MPN":"978-0-2014-8567-7","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"464","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"118","Length":"929","Weight":"198","Width":"748"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"978-0-2014-8567-7","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1999-07-08","Publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Studio":"Addison-Wesley Professional","Title":"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code","UPC":"785342485677","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"785342485677"}}}}},{"id":"098478280X","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":3995,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$39.95"},"asin":"098478280X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=098478280X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=098478280X","salesRank":107182,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wgksZup2L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wgksZup2L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions","similar":["1118261364","0201657880","1849967202","1848000693","0132350882","0984782850","1479274836","0262033844","111941847X","0672324539"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=098478280X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-25T01%3A05%3A34Z&v=2&sig=Vt%252F%252BSEEkQ4%252BW%252B8Q8Y6%252BQoGBLQVjARPpk8rP6y4eBM4Q%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Now in the 5th edition, Cracking the Coding Interview gives you the interview preparation you need to get the top software developer jobs.

Its underlying strength is its base of immense real experience, much of it quantified. Many, many varied projects have been reflected on and distilled; but what we are given is not just lifeless distillate, but vivid examples from which we share the authors’ inductions. Their premise is right: most software project problems are sociological, not technological. The insights on team jelling and work environment have changed my thinking and teaching. The third edition adds strength to strength.” </p> <p style=\"margin:0px;\">— Frederick P.

And to bring people, actual human beings, into the mix! How excellent. How rare.

Glass</h4> <p>I find I'm getting crankier in reviewing computing literature in my old age. So it came as a delightful surprise to me that I really like this book. So much so, that I would put it on a par with some of the classical studies of software management, like Fred Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month and Tom DeMarco's Peopleware.</p> <p>But I suppose I should add a note to that: this book cites some of my own wisdom (five times), and that warms the cockles of my heart, predisposing said cockles to like the rest of the book!</p> <p>And I also have to confess that the title got to me. You know the old song, \"You’re so vain, you probably think this song is about you?\" Well, I suppose I’m so vain that I thought the \"unmanageable\" programmer in this book’s title was likely me!</p> <p>But I digress. What was to like about this book? It's a \"been there, done that\" view of the problems of managing programmers, by a couple of authors whose views on that subject are comprehensive and full of insight and truth. These authors really \"get\" what programming is all about, what's unique about it, and why traditional management techniques may or may not help.</p> <p>The book is also helpful to my \"old fart\" status in the programming field. It fills in a lot of my \"old fart\" gaps, the things that have happened to the field since I was active in it. These two authors are ultra-familiar with facets of the programming field that weren't even dreamt about in my day. And, I am happy to say, what they say about those gaps fits in rather nicely around the edges of what I DO know about the field.</p> <p>There's a lot of emphasis in this book on what makes programmers, especially \"great\" programmers, different. The chapters on \"Understanding Programmers\" and \"Finding and Hiring Great Programmers\" are especially useful and right-on. And they also happily and even lustily disagree with some of the software engineering fads of our time. For example, on \"process,\" they note that it is more about the technology of programming than its management, and so little time is spent here on CMM-related topics.</p> <p>There are fascinating taxonomies of programmer types, from a \"today\" point of view. The authors see four basic contemporary types – client programmers, server programmers, database programmers, and web programmers – and note that, although most programmers think they’re good at all four, most programmers in fact are good at only one of those types of tasks. They also invent the category of \"not really programmers\" to describe those who use tools to accomplish software tasks, but who don't really write code. They also distinguish the characteristics of programmers in several categories, such as by era of birth (\"boomers,\" \"Gen Y,\" \"Millenials,\" ...)</p> <p>And the book is full of \"aha\"-type wisdom. There are three whole chapters of \"rules of thumb and nuggets of wisdom\" that are borrowed from other software authors. But there are also plenty of home-grown nuggets by these authors: <ul> <li>\"Because programmers are free spirits, typical motivational techniques are not usually successful\"</li> <li>\"It is critical to be able to appeal to a programmer's sense of self and desire to change the world\"</li> <li>\"It usually takes having been a good or great programmer to succeed as a programming manager\"</li> <li>\"We have found no difference in programmers based on age, gender, ethnic group, or culture. What differentiates programmers is what's inside each person\"</li> <li>\"A software team need a mix of a few great programmers, many ordinary programmers, domain experts, analyzers, and technical communicators\"</li> <li>\"A\" managers hire \"A\" programmers; \"B\" managers hire \"C\" programmers\" (top-notch managers are the key to project success)</li> <li>Interesting emphasis is placed on \"managing down,\" \"managing up,\" \"managing out,\" and \"managing yourself\"</li> </ul> </p> <p>The book is full of author examples and war stories, all of them to the point. </p> <p>I like this book so much that I suppose I ought to issue a warning to those who might not like it. If you believe that programmers are too independent and need taming, then you won't like this book very much. I don't, and therefore I do!</p><br/> </div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Software Development","id":"4016"},{"name":"Programming Languages","id":"3952"},{"name":"Software Design & Engineering","id":"491316"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Mickey W.
