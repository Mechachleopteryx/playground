As a teenager experimenting in his own laboratory, he was impressed by the logic and materiality of a universe governed by a small number of disembodied forces and laws that decree all things in the world are material and impermanent. But one summer evening, while looking at the stars from a small boat at sea, Lightman was overcome by the overwhelming sensation that he was merging with something larger than himself—a grand and eternal unity, a hint of something absolute and immaterial. <i>Searching for Stars on an Island in Maine </i>is Lightman's exploration of these seemingly contradictory impulses. He draws on sources ranging from Saint Augustine's conception of absolute truth to Einstein's theory of relativity, from the unity of the once-indivisible atom to the multiplicity of subatomic particles and the recent notion of multiple universes. What he gives us is a profound inquiry into the human desire for truth and meaning, and a journey along the different paths of religion and science that become part of that quest."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Memoirs","id":"3048891"},{"name":"Science & Religion","id":"12805"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Metaphysics","id":"11055"},{"name":"Phenomenology","id":"11063"},{"name":"Science & Mathematics","id":"468216"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Alan Lightman","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781101871867","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781101871867"},"Edition":"1st Edition","Format":"Deckle Edge","ISBN":"1101871865","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"779","Length":"540","Width":"91"},"Label":"Pantheon","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2495","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$24.95"},"Manufacturer":"Pantheon","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"240","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"106","Length":"795","Weight":"71","Width":"551"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-03-27","Publisher":"Pantheon","ReleaseDate":"2018-03-27","Studio":"Pantheon","Title":"Searching for Stars on an Island in Maine"}}}},{"id":"1101874023","data":{"width":54,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1524,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$15.24"},"asin":"1101874023","link":"https://www.amazon.com/War-Turpentine-novel-Stefan-Hertmans/dp/1101874023?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1101874023","url":"https://www.amazon.com/War-Turpentine-novel-Stefan-Hertmans/dp/1101874023?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1101874023","salesRank":380566,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41uwYmITB7L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"108"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41uwYmITB7L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"336"},"title":"War and Turpentine: A novel","similar":["1627795944","1590514882","0812994825","0143109278","080508908X","0525429638","0553448188","0385542364","1101906111","0062225553"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1101874023&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A14Z&v=2&sig=42Q%252Bp4moJMdCWddjOalxZ3MiCmNi5w6eTUW5RlChYRQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><b>Longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2017</b><br>A <i>New York Times</i> Top 10 Best Book of the Year<br>An <i>Economist </i>Best Book of the Year</b><br><br>The life of Urbain Martien—artist, soldier, survivor of World War I—lies contained in two notebooks he left behind when he died in 1981.

Charles Darwin played a crucial part in turning heredity into a scientific question, and yet he failed spectacularly to answer it. The birth of genetics in the early 1900s seemed to do precisely that. Gradually, people translated their old notions about heredity into a language of genes. As the technology for studying genes became cheaper, millions of people ordered genetic tests to link themselves to missing parents, to distant ancestors, to ethnic identities...<br><br>But, Zimmer writes, “Each of us carries an amalgam of fragments of DNA, stitched together from some of our many ancestors. Each piece has its own ancestry, traveling a different path back through human history. A particular fragment may sometimes be cause for worry, but most of our DNA influences who we are—our appearance, our height, our penchants—in inconceivably subtle ways.” Heredity isn’t just about genes that pass from parent to child. Heredity continues within our own bodies, as a single cell gives rise to trillions of cells that make up our bodies. We say we inherit genes from our ancestors—using a word that once referred to kingdoms and estates—but we inherit other things that matter as much or more to our lives, from microbes to technologies we use to make life more comfortable. We need a new definition of what heredity is and, through Carl Zimmer’s lucid exposition and storytelling, this resounding tour de force delivers it. <br><br>Weaving historical and current scientific research, his own experience with his two daughters, and the kind of original reporting expected of one of the world’s best science journalists, Zimmer ultimately unpacks urgent bioethical quandaries arising from new biomedical technologies, but also long-standing presumptions about who we really are and what we can pass on to future generations."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2018:</strong> Heredity is a lot more complex than most people think. In <em>She Has Her Mother’s Laugh</em>, <em>New York Times</em> columnist Carl Zimmer dives deep into the ways that we pass along our genetic inheritance. Through history, science, and a boatload of personal curiosity (the book originated from questions he had regarding his own child, and he had his entire genome mapped in the process of writing it), Zimmer seeks to retell the story of heredity in broader and more inclusive terms than the ones we’re used to hearing. For example, who we become is determined by our ancestors’ genes, yes; but it is also a product of our own cells—for one cell can contribute to millions of future cells. How we treat ourselves, what we learn, and even how we feel, eventually contributes to our hereditary future. The forces at work are myriad, mostly unseen, and subject to variables that we barely understand. Zimmer is trying to help us here, to teach us, and in doing so he succeeds in entertaining us as well. <em>--Chris Schluep, Amazon Book Review</em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Biology","id":"226688"},{"name":"Genetics","id":"13535"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Carl Zimmer","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781101984598","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781101984598"},"Edition":"1st Edition","ISBN":"1101984597","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"951","Length":"644","Width":"202"},"Label":"Dutton","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Dutton","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"672","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"220","Length":"940","Weight":"200","Width":"620"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-05-29","Publisher":"Dutton","ReleaseDate":"2018-05-29","Studio":"Dutton","Title":"She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity"}}}},{"id":"1101986093","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2545,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$25.45"},"asin":"1101986093","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Through-Two-Doors-Once-Experiment/dp/1101986093?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1101986093","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Through-Two-Doors-Once-Experiment/dp/1101986093?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1101986093","salesRank":7093,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zVVtDOmOL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zVVtDOmOL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"Through Two Doors at Once: The Elegant Experiment That Captures the Enigma of Our Quantum Reality","similar":["0674975324","0465094252","1476776628","0465096050","1847924581","0374146705","073521610X","0465052614","1541617592","0691174385"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1101986093&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A05Z&v=2&sig=f8hz0a0QgLqoxxN9qce3zdNTa9dBSWF9BIqD8xmG8nU%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><b>The intellectual adventure story of the \"double-slit\" experiment, showing how a sunbeam split into two paths first challenged our understanding of light and then the nature of reality itself--and continues to almost 200 years later.</b></b><br><br>Many of science's greatest minds have grappled with the simple yet elusive \"double-slit\" experiment. Thomas Young devised it in the early 1800s to show that light behaves like a wave, and in doing so opposed Isaac Newton. Nearly a century later, Albert Einstein showed that light comes in quanta, or particles, and the experiment became key to a fierce debate between Einstein and Niels Bohr over the nature of reality. Richard Feynman held that the double slit embodies the central mystery of the quantum world. Decade after decade, hypothesis after hypothesis, scientists have returned to this ingenious experiment to help them answer deeper and deeper questions about the fabric of the universe.<br><br>How can a single particle behave both like a particle and a wave? Does a particle exist before we look at it, or does the very act of looking create reality? Are there hidden aspects to reality missing from the orthodox view of quantum physics? Is there a place where the quantum world ends and the familiar classical world of our daily lives begins, and if so, can we find it? And if there's no such place, then does the universe split into two each time a particle goes through the double slit?<br><br>With his extraordinarily gifted eloquence, Anil Ananthaswamy travels around the world and through history, down to the smallest scales of physical reality we have yet fathomed. <i>Through Two Doors at Once</i> is the most fantastic voyage you can take."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Optics","id":"14589"},{"name":"Quantum Theory","id":"14581"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Anil Ananthaswamy","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781101986097","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781101986097"},"ISBN":"1101986093","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"930","Length":"620","Width":"100"},"Label":"Dutton","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Dutton","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"304","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"106","Length":"929","Weight":"108","Width":"642"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-08-07","Publisher":"Dutton","ReleaseDate":"2018-08-07","Studio":"Dutton","Title":"Through Two Doors at Once: The Elegant Experiment That Captures the Enigma of Our Quantum Reality"}}}},{"id":"1118057538","data":{"width":61,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":7252,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$72.52"},"asin":"1118057538","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Change-What-Science-Tells/dp/1118057538?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1118057538","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Change-What-Science-Tells/dp/1118057538?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1118057538","salesRank":384372,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51C-Z8QsQjL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"122"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51C-Z8QsQjL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"381"},"title":"Climate Change: What the Science Tells Us","similar":["1620409887","1465433643","0143130447","0300175264","1107463793","1319083501","1596911301","160469095X","0881929921","0762786787"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1118057538&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A13Z&v=2&sig=6MffECeCAlAEicc5RubTxnlCry%252BNzOrKmX9Krz0gWUk%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>Fletcher's 1st edition of \"Climate Change: What the ScienceTells Us\" places strong emphasis on the peer-reviewed literature inreporting the impacts of climate change on the ocean, terrestrialecosystems, the water cycle, human communities, dangerous weatherpatterns, and potential future Earth systems.

Our food―even what we're told is good for us―has changed for the worse in the past 100 years, its nutritional content deteriorating due to industrial farming and its composition altered due to the addition of thousands of chemicals from pesticides to packaging. We simply no longer know what we’re eating.</p><p>In <i>Formerly Known as Food</i>, Kristin Lawless argues that, because of the degradation of our diet, our bodies are literally changing from the inside out. The billion-dollar food industry is reshaping our food preferences, altering our brains, changing the composition of our microbiota, and even affecting the expression of our genes. Lawless chronicles how this is happening and what it means for our bodies, health, and survival.</p><p>An independent journalist and nutrition expert, Lawless is emerging as the voice of a new generation of food thinkers. After years of \"eat this, not that\" advice from doctors, journalists, and food faddists, she offers something completely different.

With the clarity and authority of a gifted teacher, he discusses the ideology's perspective on civil society, the rule of law, freedom, morality, property, rights, and the role of the state. In a time when many claim that conservatives lack a unified intellectual belief system, this book makes a very strong case to the contrary, one that politically-minded readers will find compelling and refreshing. </p><p>Scruton analyzes the origins and development of conservatism through the philosophies and thoughts of John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Adam Smith and Milton Friedman, among others. He shows how conservative ideas have influenced the political sector through the careers of a diverse cast of politicians, such as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Disraeli, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. He also takes a close look at the changing relationship between conservative politics, capitalism, and free markets in both the UK and the US.

Jocko Willink and Leif Babin learned this reality first-hand on the most violent and dangerous battlefield in Iraq. As leaders of SEAL Team Three’s Task Unit Bruiser, their mission was one many thought impossible: help U.S. forces secure Ramadi, a violent, insurgent-held city deemed “all but lost.” In gripping, firsthand accounts of heroism, tragic loss, and hard-won victories, they learned that leadership―at every level―is the most important factor in whether a team succeeds or fails. </p><p>Willink and Babin returned home from deployment and instituted SEAL leadership training to pass on their harsh lessons learned in combat to help forge the next generation of SEAL leaders. After leaving the SEAL Teams, they launched a company, Echelon Front, to teach those same leadership principles to leaders in businesses, companies, and organizations across the civilian sector. Since that time, they have trained countless leaders and worked with hundreds of companies in virtually every industry across the U.S. and internationally, teaching them how to develop their own high-performance teams and most effectively lead those teams to dominate their battlefields.</p><p>Since it’s release in October 2015, <i>Extreme Ownership </i>has revolutionized leadership development and set a new standard for literature on the subject. Required reading for many of the most successful organizations, it has become an integral part of the official leadership training programs for scores of business teams, military units, and first responders. Detailing the mindset and principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult combat missions, <i>Extreme Ownership</i> demonstrates how to apply them to any team or organization, in any leadership environment. A compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, <i>Extreme Ownership</i> challenges leaders everywhere to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Success","id":"4749"},{"name":"Iraq War","id":"9681306011"},{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Intelligence & Espionage","id":"5015"},{"name":"United States","id":"5022"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jocko Willink","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"St. Martin's Press","EAN":"9781250183866","EANList":{"EANListElement":["4708364212683","9781250183866"]},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"1250183863","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"880","Length":"595","Weight":"100","Width":"124"},"Label":"St. Martin's Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2799","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.99"},"Manufacturer":"St. Martin's Press","MPN":"27200618","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"384","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"830","Weight":"100","Width":"560"},"PartNumber":"27200618","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-11-21","Publisher":"St. Martin's Press","ReleaseDate":"2017-11-21","Studio":"St. Martin's Press","Title":"Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win (New Edition)"}}}},{"id":"1250200911","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2609,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$26.09"},"asin":"1250200911","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Diversity-Delusion-Pandering-University-Undermine/dp/1250200911?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1250200911","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Diversity-Delusion-Pandering-University-Undermine/dp/1250200911?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1250200911","salesRank":40224,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hlG0fns2L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hlG0fns2L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"The Diversity Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and Undermine Our Culture","similar":["0525540075","0062835521","1501183664","1943003181","1682617300","0735224897","1682618137","1250163773","0451498399","154164560X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1250200911&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A07Z&v=2&sig=OsQ8Tw2v41cilMpE9Aa5wRAAfbhTTzL59k%252FjpbJNMww%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><b>By the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author: a provocative account of the attack on the humanities, the rise of intolerance, and the erosion of serious learning</b><br><b></b><br>America is in crisis, from the university to the workplace. Toxic ideas first spread by higher education have undermined humanistic values, fueled intolerance, and widened divisions in our larger culture. Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton? Oppressive. American history? Tyranny. Professors correcting grammar and spelling, or employers hiring by merit? Racist and sexist. Students emerge into the working world believing that human beings are defined by their skin color, gender, and sexual preference, and that oppression based on these characteristics is the American experience. Speech that challenges these campus orthodoxies is silenced with brute force.</p><p><i>The Diversity Delusion</i> argues that the root of this problem is the belief in America’s endemic racism and sexism, a belief that has engendered a metastasizing diversity bureaucracy in society and academia. Diversity commissars denounce meritocratic standards as discriminatory, enforce hiring quotas, and teach students and adults alike to think of themselves as perpetual victims. From #MeToo mania that blurs flirtations with criminal acts, to implicit bias and diversity compliance training that sees racism in every interaction, Heather Mac Donald argues that we are creating a nation of narrowed minds, primed for grievance, and that we are putting our competitive edge at risk. </p><p>But there is hope in the works of authors, composers, and artists who have long inspired the best in us.

In Agriculture the funding of vital programs like food stamps and school lunches is being slashed. The Commerce Department may not have enough staff to conduct the 2020 Census properly. Over at Energy, where international nuclear risk is managed, it’s not clear there will be enough inspectors to track and locate black market uranium before terrorists do.</p><p>Willful ignorance plays a role in these looming disasters. If your ambition is to maximize short-term gains without regard to the long-term cost, you are better off not knowing those costs. If you want to preserve your personal immunity to the hard problems, it’s better never to really understand those problems. There is upside to ignorance, and downside to knowledge. Knowledge makes life messier. It makes it a bit more difficult for a person who wishes to shrink the world to a worldview.</p><p>If there are dangerous fools in this book, there are also heroes, unsung, of course.

The other books in the series are <i>Fooled by Randomness, Antifragile, Skin in the Game, </i>and <i>The Bed of Procrustes</i>.</b><br><br>A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br> <br>Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”<br> <br>For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world.

We're still doing it.<br><br> Our brains are wired for narrative, not statistical uncertainty. And so we tell ourselves simple stories to explain complex thing we don't--and, most importantly, can't--know. The truth is that we have no idea why stock markets go up or down on any given day, and whatever reason we give is sure to be grossly simplified, if not flat out wrong.<br><br> Nassim Nicholas Taleb first made this argument in <i>Fooled by Randomness,</i> an engaging look at the history and reasons for our predilection for self-deception when it comes to statistics. Now, in <i>The Black Swan: the Impact of the Highly Improbable,</i> he focuses on that most dismal of sciences, predicting the future. Forecasting is not just at the heart of Wall Street, but it’s something each of us does every time we make an insurance payment or strap on a seat belt.<br><br> The problem, Nassim explains, is that we place too much weight on the odds that past events will repeat (diligently trying to follow the path of the \"millionaire next door,\" when unrepeatable chance is a better explanation). Instead, the really important events are rare and unpredictable. He calls them Black Swans, which is a reference to a 17th century philosophical thought experiment. In Europe all anyone had ever seen were white swans; indeed, \"all swans are white\" had long been used as the standard example of a scientific truth. So what was the chance of seeing a black one? Impossible to calculate, or at least they were until 1697, when explorers found Cygnus atratus in Australia.<br><br> Nassim argues that most of the really big events in our world are rare and unpredictable, and thus trying to extract generalizable stories to explain them may be emotionally satisfying, but it's practically useless. September 11th is one such example, and stock market crashes are another. Or, as he puts it, \"History does not crawl, it jumps.\" Our assumptions grow out of the bell-curve predictability of what he calls \"Mediocristan,\" while our world is really shaped by the wild powerlaw swings of \"Extremistan.\"<br><br> In full disclosure, I'm a long admirer of Taleb's work and a few of my comments on drafts found their way into the book. I, too, look at the world through the powerlaw lens, and I too find that it reveals how many of our assumptions are wrong. But Taleb takes this to a new level with a delightful romp through history, economics, and the frailties of human nature. <i>--Chris Anderson</i><br><br> <hr noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" class=\"bucketDivider\" /><br>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Personal Transformation","id":"4745"},{"name":"Corporate Finance","id":"2607"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"Computer Science","id":"3508"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Probability & Statistics","id":"13983"},{"name":"Statistics","id":"52161011"},{"name":"Epistemology","id":"11035"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Hyperion EA","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["POXM-1400063515","XM-1400063515"]},"EAN":"9781400063512","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781400063512"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Random House NY","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1400063515","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"954","Length":"643","Weight":"100","Width":"148"},"Label":"Random House","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$35.00"},"Manufacturer":"Random House","MPN":"black 0909a90e0aw32w2","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"366","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"120","Length":"950","Weight":"185","Width":"620"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"black 0909a90e0aw32w2","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2007-04-17","Publisher":"Random House","ReleaseDate":"2007-04-17","Studio":"Random House","Title":"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable (Incerto)"}}}},{"id":"1400067820","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1781,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.81"},"asin":"1400067820","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/1400067820?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1400067820","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/1400067820?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1400067820","salesRank":25250,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KkWX8TowL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KkWX8TowL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"330"},"title":"Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder (Incerto)","similar":["1400067936","1400063515","1400069971","042528462X","0812982401","0471152803","0812975219","0374275637","0393080943","0735216355"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1400067820&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A59Z&v=2&sig=0Elx6bVZ5iDdW50sy1x91o7HpKzri%252Fkw5aTppTgr%252F7A%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><i>Antifragile </i>is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto series, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don’t understand.

What Taleb has identified and calls “antifragile” is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.  <br><br> In <i>The Black Swan, </i>Taleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. In <i>Antifragile,</i> Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better. <br><br> Furthermore, the antifragile is immune to prediction errors and protected from adverse events. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is what we call “efficient” not efficient at all? Why do government responses and social policies protect the strong and hurt the weak? Why should you write your resignation letter before even starting on the job? How did the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> save lives? The book spans innovation by trial and error, life decisions, politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are loud and clear.<br><br> <i>Antifragile</i> is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.<br><br> Erudite, witty, and iconoclastic, Taleb’s message is revolutionary: The antifragile, and only the antifragile, will make it.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Antifragile</i></b><br><br>“Ambitious and thought-provoking . . . highly entertaining.”<b>—<i>The Economist</i></b><br><br> “A bold book explaining how and why we should embrace uncertainty, randomness, and error . . .

But, according to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, there's an entire class of other things that don't simply resist stress but actually grow, strengthen, or otherwise gain from unforeseen and otherwise unwelcome stimuli. Taleb sees degrees of antifragility everywhere, from fasting, mythology, and urban planning to economic, technological, cultural, and biological systems. The wealth of radical thinking in this book astounds; the glossary alone offered more thought-provoking ideas than any other nonfiction book I read this year. That said, <i>Antifragile</i> is far from flawless. As comical as Taleb's rough handling of his favorite targets can be--academics, economists, and tourists, to name a few--his argumentative style boasts gaping holes, non sequiturs aplenty, and at times an almost willfully repugnant tone. Some readers will find Taleb's brashness off-putting; others will embrace it as a charismatic component of the ideas themselves. Either way, no one will finish this book unchanged. --<i>Jason Kirk</i>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Stocks","id":"2674"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"Psychology & Counseling","id":"11119"},{"name":"General","id":"6511988011"},{"name":"Phenomenology","id":"11063"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Random House","EAN":"9781400067824","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9781400067824","8601421337724"]},"Edition":"First Edition","Feature":"Random House","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1400067820","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"952","Length":"644","Weight":"180","Width":"133"},"Label":"Random House","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Random House","MPN":"35061009","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"544","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"160","Length":"940","Weight":"180","Width":"640"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"35061009","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2012-11-27","Publisher":"Random House","ReleaseDate":"2012-11-27","Studio":"Random House","Title":"Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder (Incerto)"}}}},{"id":"1400067936","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2274,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$22.74"},"asin":"1400067936","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/1400067936?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1400067936","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/1400067936?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1400067936","salesRank":135189,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kDWzNxl0L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kDWzNxl0L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets (Incerto)","similar":["1400063515","1400067820","1400069971","042528462X","0374275637","0471152803","0231153686","0691166269","0393080943","0061854549"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1400067936&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A59Z&v=2&sig=1YD4sx1kwIzehuaYKarnnRTgstjDVcW1hfo6QhcM4hA%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><i>Fooled by Randomness </i>is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto series, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don’t understand.

Food vendors would show up, as well as spectators. Then, someone would throw a rock or a bottle.</p> <p>When the major met with Kufa’s mayor, he made an odd request: Could they keep food vendors out of the plazas? Sure, the mayor said. A few weeks later, a small crowd gathered near the Great Mosque of Kufa. It grew in size. Some people started chanting angry slogans. At dusk, the crowd started getting restless and hungry. People looked for the kebab sellers normally filling the plaza, but there were none to be found. The spectators left. The chanters became dispirited. By 8 p.m., everyone was gone.</p> <p>I asked the major how he had figured out that removing food vendors would change peoples' behavior.</p> <p>The U.S. military, he told me, is one of the biggest habit-formation experiments in history. “Understanding habits is the most important thing I’ve learned in the army,” he said. By the time I got back to the U.S., I was hooked on the topic.</p> <p><strong>How have your own habits changed as a result of writing this book?</strong><br /> Since starting work on this book, I've lost about 30 pounds, I run every other morning (I'm training for the NY Marathon later this year), and I'm much more productive. And the reason why is because I've learned to diagnose my habits, and how to change them.</p> <p>Take, for instance, a bad habit I had of eating a cookie every afternoon. By learning how to analyze my habit, I figured out that the reason I walked to the cafeteria each day wasn't because I was craving a chocolate chip cookie. It was because I was craving socialization, the company of talking to my colleagues while munching. That was the habit's real reward. And the cue for my behavior - the trigger that caused me to automatically stand up and wander to the cafeteria, was a certain time of day.</p> <p>So, I reconstructed the habit: now, at about 3:30 each day, I absentmindedly stand up from my desk, look around for someone to talk with, and then gossip for about 10 minutes. I don't even think about it at this point. It's automatic. It's a habit. I haven't had a cookie in six months.</p> <p><strong>What was the most surprising use of habits that you uncovered? </strong><br /> The most surprising thing I've learned is how companies use the science of habit formation to study - and influence - what we buy.</p> <p>Take, for example, Target, the giant retailer. Target collects all kinds of data on every shopper it can, including whether you’re married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how much money you earn, if you've moved recently, the websites you visit. And with that information, it tries to diagnose each consumer’s unique, individual habits.</p> <p>Why? Because Target knows that there are these certain moments when our habits become flexible. When we buy a new house, for instance, or get married or have a baby, our shopping habits are in flux. A well-timed coupon or advertisement can convince us to buy in a whole new way. But figuring out when someone is buying a house or getting married or having a baby is tough.

Lilienfeld, Steven Jay Lynn, John Ruscio, and Barry L. Beyerstein, the authors of <i>50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology</i> <p/> Virtually every day, the news media, television shows, films, and Internet bombard us with claims regarding a host of psychological topics: psychics, out of body experiences, recovered memories, and lie detection, to name merely a few. Even a casual stroll through our neighborhood bookstore reveals dozens of self-help, relationship, recovery, and addiction books that serve up generous portions of advice for steering our paths along life’s rocky road. Yet many popular psychology sources are rife with misconceptions. Indeed, in today’s fast-paced world of information overload, <i>misinformation</i> about psychology is at least as widespread as accurate information. Self-help gurus, television talk show hosts, and self-proclaimed mental health experts routinely dispense psychological advice that’s a bewildering mix of truths, half-truths, and outright falsehoods. Without a dependable tour guide for sorting out psychological myth from reality, we’re at risk for becoming lost in a jungle of “psychomythology.” <p/> In our new book, <i>50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread Misconceptions About Human Nature</i>, we examine in depth 50 widespread myths in popular psychology (along with approximately 250 other myths and “mini-myths”), present research evidence demonstrating that these beliefs are fictional, explore their ramifications in popular culture and everyday life, and trace their psychological and sociological origins. Here, in David Letterman-like style, we present - in no particular order – our own candidates for five big myths of popular psychology. <p/> <b>Myth # 1: </b><i> Most people use only 10% of their brain power</i> <br/> There are several reasons to doubt that 90% of our brains lie silent. At a mere 2-3% of our body weight, our brain consumes over 20% of the oxygen we breathe. It’s implausible that evolution would have permitted the squandering of resources on a scale necessary to build and maintain such a massively underutilized organ. Moreover, losing far less than 90% of the brain to accident or disease almost always has catastrophic consequences (Kolb & Whishaw, 2003). <p/> How did the 10% myth get started? One clue leads back about a century to psychologist William James, who once wrote that he doubted that average persons achieve more than about 10% of their <i>intellectual potential</i>. Although James talked in terms of underdeveloped potential, a slew of positive thinking gurus transformed “10% of our capacity” into “10% of our brain” (Beyerstein, 1999). <p/> <b>Myth # 2:</b> <i>It’s better to express anger than to hold it in</i><br/> If you’re like most people, you believe that releasing anger is healthier than bottling it up. In one survey, 66% of undergraduates agreed that expressing pent-up anger--sometimes called “catharsis”--is an effective means of reducing one’s risk for aggression (Brown, 1983). <p/> Yet more than 40 years of research reveals that expressing anger directly toward another person or indirectly (such as toward an object) actually turns up the heat on aggression (Bushman, Baumeister, & Stack, 1999; Tavris, 1988). Research suggests that expressing anger is helpful only when it’s accompanied by constructive problem-solving designed to address the source of the anger (Littrell, 1998). <p/> Why is this myth so popular? In all likelihood, people often mistakenly attribute the fact that they feel better after they express anger to catharsis, rather than to the fact that anger usually subsides on its own after awhile (Lohr, Olatunji, Baumeister, & Bushman, 2007). <p/> <b>Myth # 3:</b><i> Low Self-Esteem is a Major Cause of Psychological Problems</i><br/> Many popular psychologists have long maintained that low self-esteem is a prime culprit in generating unhealthy behaviors, including violence, depression, anxiety, and alcoholism. The self-esteem movement has found its way into mainstream educational practices. Some athletic leagues award trophies to all schoolchildren to avoid making losing competitors feel inferior (Sommers & Satel, 2005). Moreover, the Internet is chock full of educational products intended to boost children’s self-esteem. <p/> But there’s a fly in the ointment: Research shows that low self esteem isn’t strongly associated with poor mental health. In a painstakingly - and probably painful! - review, Roy Baumeister and his colleagues (2003) canvassed over 15,000 studies linking self-esteem to just about every conceivable psychological variable. They found that self-esteem is minimally related to interpersonal success, and not consistently related to alcohol or drug abuse. Perhaps most surprising of all, they found that “low self-esteem is neither necessary nor sufficient for depression” (Baumeister et al., 2003, p. 6). <p/> <b>Myth # 4:</b><i> Human memory works like a tape recorder or video camera, and accurately records the events we’ve experienced</i><br/> Despite the sometimes all-too-obvious failings of everyday memory, surveys show that many people believe that their memories operate very much like tape recorders, video cameras, or DVDs. It’s true that we often recall extremely emotional events, sometimes called <i>flashbulb memories</i> because they seem to have a photographic quality (Brown & Kulik, 1977). Nevertheless, research shows that even these memories wither over time and are prone to distortions (Krackow, Lynn, & Payne, 2005-2006). <p/> Today, there’s broad consensus among psychologists that memory isn’t <i>reproductive</i>—it doesn’t duplicate precisely what we’ve experienced—but <i>reconstructive</i>. What we recall is often a blurry mixture of accurate and inaccurate recollections, along with what jells with our beliefs and hunches. Rather than viewing our memory as a tape recorder, we can more aptly describe our memory as an ever-changing medium that highlights our ability to create fluid narratives of our experiences. <p/> <b>Myth # 5:</b> <i>Hypnosis is a unique “trance” state that differs in kind from wakefulness</i><br/> Popular movies and books portray the hypnotic trance state as so powerful that otherwise normal people will commit an assassination (<i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>); commit suicide (<i>The Garden Murders</i>); perceive only a person’s internal beauty (<i>Shallow Hal</i>); and our favorite, fall victim to brainwashing by alien preachers who use messages embedded in sermons (<i>Invasion of the Space Preachers</i>). <p/> But research shows that hypnotized people can resist and even oppose hypnotic suggestions (Lynn, Rhue, & Weekes, 1990; Nash, 2001), and won’t do things that are out of character, like harming people they dislike. In addition, hypnosis bears no more than a superficial resemblance to sleep: Brain wave studies reveal that hypnotized people are wide awake. <p/> So there’s no reason to believe that hypnosis differs in kind from normal wakefulness. Instead, hypnosis appears to be only one procedure among many for increasing people’s responses to suggestions. <p/> More information about each of these myths and a complete list of references are available in <i>50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology</i>. <p/>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Reference","id":"11205"},{"name":"Mythology & Folklore","id":"11749"},{"name":"Psychology","id":"491490"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Scott O.

Everything. Our lives are about to be dramatically shaken—as altered as they were by the invention of the clock, the steam engine, the railroad, the radio and the Internet. <BR><BR>In <I>About Time, </I>astrophysicist Adam Frank allows us a peek into the cutting edge of cosmology, explaining how the texture of our lives changes along with our understanding of the universe’s origin. Since we awoke to self-consciousness fifty thousand years ago, our lived experience of time, from hunting and gathering to the invention of cell phones and electronic calendars, has been transformed and rebuilt many times. But the latest theories in cosmology—time with no beginning, parallel universes, eternal inflation—are about to send us in a new direction. <BR><BR>Time is both our grandest and most intimate conception of the universe. Frank tells the story of humanity’s deepest question—when and how did everything begin?—alongside the story of how human beings have experienced time, looking at the way our engagement with the world has allowed us to discover the nature of the universe and how those discoveries inform our daily experience. This astounding book will change the way we think about time and how it affects our lives."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"United States","id":"4853"},{"name":"Cosmology","id":"13449"},{"name":"Time","id":"14598"},{"name":"History","id":"468230"},{"name":"Science & Mathematics","id":"468216"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Adam Frank","Binding":"Paperback","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["XM-1439169608","POXM-1439169608"]},"EAN":"9781439169605","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781439169605"},"Edition":"Reprint","ISBN":"1439169608","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"844","Length":"550","Weight":"79","Width":"110"},"Label":"Free Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1900","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$19.00"},"Manufacturer":"Free Press","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"432","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"110","Length":"840","Weight":"88","Width":"550"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2012-09-11","Publisher":"Free Press","ReleaseDate":"2012-09-11","Studio":"Free Press","Title":"About Time: Cosmology and Culture at the Twilight of the Big Bang"}}}},{"id":"1439195463","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":998,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$9.98"},"asin":"1439195463","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment/dp/1439195463?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1439195463","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment/dp/1439195463?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1439195463","salesRank":2957,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WjMUyaOfL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WjMUyaOfL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"328"},"title":"Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment","similar":["0679763996","1573226564","031606744X","0679758941","1451636024","1549811681","1622036050","1594204225","0767903323","1641520477"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1439195463&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A17Z&v=2&sig=lXfodCGHBUCgeEYwp52v2lKmeBdXapKx97j63Ti0TKc%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"From one of America’s most brilliant writers, a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling journey through psychology, philosophy, and lots of meditation to show how Buddhism holds the key to moral clarity and enduring happiness.<BR><BR>At the heart of Buddhism is a simple claim: The reason we suffer—and the reason we make other people suffer—is that we don’t see the world clearly. At the heart of Buddhist meditative practice is a radical promise: We can learn to see the world, including ourselves, more clearly and so gain a deep and morally valid happiness.<BR> <BR> In this “sublime” (<i>The New Yorker</i>), pathbreaking book, Robert Wright shows how taking this promise seriously can change your life—how it can loosen the grip of anxiety, regret, and hatred, and how it can deepen your appreciation of beauty and of other people. He also shows <i>why </i>this transformation works, drawing on the latest in neuroscience and psychology, and armed with an acute understanding of human evolution.<BR> <BR> This book is the culmination of a personal journey that began with Wright’s landmark book on evolutionary psychology, <i>The Moral Animal</i>, and deepened as he immersed himself in meditative practice and conversed with some of the world’s most skilled meditators. The result is a story that is “provocative, informative and...deeply rewarding” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>), and as entertaining as it is illuminating. Written with the wit, clarity, and grace for which Wright is famous, <i>Why Buddhism Is True</i> lays the foundation for a spiritual life in a secular age and shows how, in a time of technological distraction and social division, we can save ourselves from ourselves, both as individuals and as a species."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Happiness","id":"4739"},{"name":"Evolutionary

He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.   <P>Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. <P>Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2011</strong>: It is difficult to read the opening pages of Walter Isaacson’s <em>Steve Jobs</em> without feeling melancholic. Jobs retired at the end of August and died about six weeks later. Now, just weeks after his death, you can open the book that bears his name and read about his youth, his promise, and his relentless press to succeed. But the initial sadness in starting the book is soon replaced by something else, which is the intensity of the read--mirroring the intensity of Jobs’s focus and vision for his products. Few in history have transformed their time like Steve Jobs, and one could argue that he stands with the Fords, Edisons, and Gutenbergs of the world. This is a timely and complete portrait that pulls no punches and gives insight into a man whose contradictions were in many ways his greatest strength. <em>--Chris Schluep</em><br/> <br/> <br/> <p><span class=\"h1\"><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&A with Walter Isaacson </strong></span><br /><span class=\"h1\"><strong> </strong></span><img height=\"300\" src=\" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/SIMON/IsaacsonWalter._V164348457_.jpg\" style=\"float: right;\" width=\"450\" /></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> It's becoming well known that Jobs was able to create his Reality Distortion Field when it served him. Was it difficult for you to cut through the RDF and get beneath the narrative that he created? How did you do it? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Steve on the original Macintosh team, said that even if you were aware of his Reality Distortion Field, you still got caught up in it. But that is why Steve was so successful: He willfully bent reality so that you became convinced you could do the impossible, so you did. I never felt he was intentionally misleading me, but I did try to check every story. I did more than a hundred interviews. And he urged me not just to hear his version, but to interview as many people as possible. It was one of his many odd contradictions: He could distort reality, yet he was also brutally honest most of the time. He impressed upon me the value of honesty, rather than trying to whitewash things.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How were the interviews with Jobs conducted? Did you ask lots of questions, or did he just talk? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> I asked very few questions. We would take long walks or drives, or sit in his garden, and I would raise a topic and let him expound on it. Even during the more formal sessions in his living room, I would just sit quietly and listen. He loved to tell stories, and he would get very emotional, especially when talking about people in his life whom he admired or disdained.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He was a powerful man who could hold a grudge. Was it easy to get others to talk about Jobs willingly? Were they afraid to talk? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Everyone was eager to talk about Steve. They all had stories to tell, and they loved to tell them. Even those who told me about his rough manner put it in the context of how inspiring he could be.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jobs embraced the counterculture and Buddhism. Yet he was a billionaire businessman with his own jet. In what way did Jobs' contradictions contribute to his success?</p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Steve was filled with contradictions. He was a counterculture rebel who became a billionaire. He eschewed material objects yet made objects of desire. He talked, at times, about how he wrestled with these contradictions. His counterculture background combined with his love of electronics and business was key to the products he created. They combined artistry and technology. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jobs could be notoriously difficult. Did you wind up liking him in the end? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Yes, I liked him and was inspired by him. But I knew he could be unkind and rough. These things can go together. When my book first came out, some people skimmed it quickly and cherry-picked the examples of his being rude to people. But that was only half the story. Fortunately, as people read the whole book, they saw the theme of the narrative: He could be petulant and rough, but this was driven by his passion and pursuit of perfection. He liked people to stand up to him, and he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team. And the teams he built became extremely loyal and inspired. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you believe he was a genius? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He was a genius at connecting art to technology, of making leaps based on intuition and imagination. He knew how to make emotional connections with those around him and with his customers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did he have regrets? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He had some regrets, which he expressed in his interviews. For example, he said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend. But he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at Apple and the loyalty of both his close colleagues and his family.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think is his legacy?</p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> His legacy is transforming seven industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores. His legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth, one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now. His legacy, as he said in his \"Think Different\" ad, was reminding us that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.</p> <p> <b>Photo credit:</b> Patrice Gilbert Photography</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Business","id":"2420"},{"name":"Computers & Technology","id":"886498"},{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Biographies","id":"3568"},{"name":"History","id":"3573"},{"name":"Engineering","id":"173515"},{"name":"Technology","id":"14631"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Walter Isaacson","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"PowerbookMedic","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["POXM-1451648537","XM-1451648537"]},"EAN":"9781451648539","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9781451648539","8601400189702"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"the life and times of Steve Jobs","IsAdultProduct":"0","IsAutographed":"0","ISBN":"1451648537","IsMemorabilia":"0","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"612","Weight":"216","Width":"190"},"Label":"Simon & Schuster","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$35.00"},"Manufacturer":"Simon & Schuster","MPN":"A-086-738","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"656","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"170","Length":"930","Weight":"215","Width":"640"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"A-086-738","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2011-10-24","Publisher":"Simon & Schuster","ReleaseDate":"2011-10-24","Studio":"Simon & Schuster","Title":"Steve Jobs"}}}},{"id":"1451673264","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1625,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.25"},"asin":"1451673264","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Fahrenheit-451-Ray-Bradbury/dp/1451673264?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1451673264","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Fahrenheit-451-Ray-Bradbury/dp/1451673264?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1451673264","salesRank":6474,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WDBsL9cDL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WDBsL9cDL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"325"},"title":"Fahrenheit 451","similar":["1328869334","0062696122","0143124293","0151072558","0679437223","0151010269","0679420398","0062420704","1439501637","0316769533"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1451673264&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A23Z&v=2&sig=V3oV4BoRAlyjHEvB4e8PfGNXjg2%252BYYtT2wyuvjU3JeQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<B>Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel <I>Fahrenheit 451</I> is a masterwork of twentieth-century literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. </B><BR><BR><B>Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 is a masterwork of twentieth-century literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. </B><BR><BR>Guy Montag is a fireman.

She exposes the ideological desperation of the climate-change deniers, the messianic delusions of the would-be geoengineers, and the tragic defeatism of too many mainstream green initiatives.

The family’s story starts with Hoonie, a young Korean man born with physical deformities, but whose destiny comes from his inner strength and kindness. Hoonie’s daughter, rather than bring shame on her family, leaves their homeland for Japan, where her children and grandchildren will be born and raised; yet prejudice against their Korean heritage will prevent them from ever feeling at home. In <em>Pachinko</em>, Min Jin Lee says much about success and suffering, prejudice and tradition, but the novel never bogs down and only becomes richer, like a sauce left simmering hour after hour. Lee’s exceptional story of one family is the story of many of the world’s people. They ask only for the chance to belong somewhere—and to be judged by their hearts and actions rather than by ideas of blood traits and bad seeds. <em>--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review</em></p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Family Saga","id":"10163"},{"name":"Cultural Heritage","id":"8946929011"},{"name":"Family Life","id":"11047977011"},{"name":"Asian American","id":"9857"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Min Jin Lee","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Grand Central Publishing","EAN":"9781455563937","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781455563937"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Grand Central Publishing","ISBN":"1455563935","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"638","Weight":"0","Width":"150"},"Label":"Grand Central Publishing","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Grand Central Publishing","MPN":"45233324","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"496","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"160","Length":"910","Weight":"150","Width":"610"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"45233324","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-02-07","Publisher":"Grand Central Publishing","ReleaseDate":"2017-02-07","Studio":"Grand Central Publishing","Title":"Pachinko (National Book Award Finalist)"}}}},{"id":"1456492543","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":999,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$9.99"},"asin":"1456492543","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Sleep-Method-Incredible-Insomnia/dp/1456492543?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1456492543","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Sleep-Method-Incredible-Insomnia/dp/1456492543?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1456492543","salesRank":308668,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41VP36aKcbL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41VP36aKcbL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"The Effortless Sleep Method:  The Incredible New Cure for Insomnia and Chronic Sleep Problems","similar":["0805089586","0957104812","1572246359","1936303728","1499250533","1626253439","0399583610","0957104820","1572246278","0399532978"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1456492543&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A27Z&v=2&sig=aU6t7TCGzRi%252FyR33AFdYxw8ZSOl7GTEpXQHuYoL8qJU%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"The Effortless Sleep Method is the approach insomniacs all over the world have been waiting for.

An additional 64-page reference section provides a more conventional account of events in human history.</p><p>Placing humans in the context of our universe and revealing how and why we got to where we are today, <i>Big History</i> covers 13.8 billion years of history, from the formation of the universe and the dawn of time to the present day.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Reference","id":"4989"},{"name":"World","id":"5035"},{"name":"History","id":"11732"},{"name":"Cosmology","id":"13449"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"}],"attributes":{"Author":"DK","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"DK Publishing Dorling Kindersley","Creator":"David Christian","EAN":"9781465454430","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781465454430"},"Feature":"DK Publishing Dorling Kindersley","ISBN":"1465454438","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1213","Length":"1044","Weight":"564","Width":"138"},"Label":"DK","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"5000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$50.00"},"Manufacturer":"DK","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"440","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"142","Length":"1197","Weight":"564","Width":"1008"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-10-11","Publisher":"DK","ReleaseDate":"2016-10-11","Studio":"DK","Title":"Big History: Examines Our Past, Explains Our Present, Imagines Our Future"}}}},{"id":"1476702713","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1467,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.67"},"asin":"1476702713","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Excellent-Sheep-Miseducation-American-Meaningful/dp/1476702713?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1476702713","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Excellent-Sheep-Miseducation-American-Meaningful/dp/1476702713?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1476702713","salesRank":303464,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fnXeHzNxL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fnXeHzNxL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"335"},"title":"Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life","similar":["1455532703","0300122233","1594202885","1627791779","0743222970","0465028020","0143121251","006059585X","0743222989","0226028569"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1476702713&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A11Z&v=2&sig=yIPL8%252BExiU3PEfWWmK8HPC%252F0Oh7uU0KvCdWhR8ncAwI%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"A groundbreaking manifesto for people searching for the kind of insight on leading, thinking, and living that elite schools should be—but aren’t—providing.<BR><BR>As a professor at Yale, Bill Deresiewicz saw something that troubled him deeply.

Now, for the first time, he has assembled an invaluable “distillation of just about every good personal finance idea of the last forty years” (<i>The New York Times</i>).<BR> <BR>Based on extensive research and interviews with some of the most legendary investors at work today (John Bogle, Warren Buffett, Paul Tudor Jones, Ray Dalio, Carl Icahn, and many others), Tony Robbins has created a 7-step blueprint for securing financial freedom. With advice about taking control of your financial decisions, to setting up a savings and investing plan, to destroying myths about what it takes to save and invest, to setting up a “lifetime income plan,” the book brims with advice and practices for making the financial game not only winnable—but providing financial freedom for the rest of your life. “Put <i>MONEY</i> on your short list of new books to read…It’s that good” (Marketwatch.com)."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Motivational","id":"4744"},{"name":"Success","id":"4749"},{"name":"Personal Finance","id":"2717"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Tony Robbins","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Tony Robbins","EAN":"9781476757865","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601423537887","9781476757865"]},"Edition":"Updated","Feature":"MONEY Master the Game 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom","ISBN":"1476757860","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Weight":"193","Width":"120"},"Label":"Simon & Schuster","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$18.00"},"Manufacturer":"Simon & Schuster","MPN":"24548599","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"688","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"140","Length":"910","Weight":"193","Width":"610"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"24548599","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-03-29","Publisher":"Simon & Schuster","ReleaseDate":"2016-03-29","Studio":"Simon & Schuster","Title":"MONEY Master the Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom"}}}},{"id":"1476776628","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1899,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$18.99"},"asin":"1476776628","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Tangled-Tree-Radical-History-Life/dp/1476776628?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1476776628","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Tangled-Tree-Radical-History-Life/dp/1476776628?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1476776628","salesRank":109,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511VyUmL9cL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511VyUmL9cL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life","similar":["0674975324","1101986093","1101984597","1541617592","0670024937","110187032X","0374287864","0062490427","160358739X","0525512179"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1476776628&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A57Z&v=2&sig=l%252BfFY12iLAZ5XGh3SpzrjzPDg1CKKdqJpi08AXgGwMg%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>Nonpareil science writer David Quammen explains how recent discoveries in molecular biology can change our understanding of evolution and life’s history, with powerful implications for human health and even our own human nature. </b><BR><BR>In the mid-1970s, scientists began using DNA sequences to reexamine the history of all life. Perhaps the most startling discovery to come out of this new field—the study of life’s diversity and relatedness at the molecular level—is horizontal gene transfer (HGT), or the movement of genes across species lines. It turns out that HGT has been widespread and important. For instance, we now know that roughly eight percent of the human genome arrived not through traditional inheritance from directly ancestral forms, but sideways by viral infection—a type of HGT.<BR> <BR> In <i>The </i><i>Tangled Tree</i> David Quammen, “one of that rare breed of science journalists who blends exploration with a talent for synthesis and storytelling” (<i>Nature</i>), chronicles these discoveries through the lives of the researchers who made them—such as Carl Woese, the most important little-known biologist of the twentieth century; Lynn Margulis, the notorious maverick whose wild ideas about “mosaic” creatures proved to be true; and Tsutomu Wantanabe, who discovered that the scourge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a direct result of horizontal gene transfer, bringing the deep study of genome histories to bear on a global crisis in public health.<BR> <BR> “Quammen is no ordinary writer. He is simply astonishing, one of that rare class of writer gifted with verve, ingenuity, humor, guts, and great heart” (<i>Elle</i>). Now, in <i>The Tangled Tree</i>, he explains how molecular studies of evolution have brought startling recognitions about the tangled tree of life—including where we humans fit upon it. Thanks to new technologies such as CRISPR, we now have the ability to alter even our genetic composition—through sideways insertions, as nature has long been doing. <i>The Tangled Tree </i>is a brilliant guide to our transformed understanding of evolution, of life’s history, and of our own human nature."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Biology","id":"226688"},{"name":"Zoology","id":"13563"},{"name":"Genetics","id":"13535"}],"attributes":{"Author":"David Quammen","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781476776620","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781476776620"},"ISBN":"1476776628","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"150"},"Label":"Simon & Schuster","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Simon & Schuster","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"480","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"142","Length":"929","Weight":"157","Width":"646"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-08-14","Publisher":"Simon & Schuster","ReleaseDate":"2018-08-14","Studio":"Simon & Schuster","Title":"The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life"}}}},{"id":"1476795924","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1800,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$18.00"},"asin":"1476795924","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Turbulent-Doris-Kearns-Goodwin/dp/1476795924?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1476795924","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Turbulent-Doris-Kearns-Goodwin/dp/1476795924?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1476795924","salesRank":868,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ixEfMoVYL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ixEfMoVYL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"Leadership: In Turbulent Times","similar":["0307409600","1501175513","0385542534","0525426760","0399589813","0062803700","0062438980","1324002646","1101980990","0312060270"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1476795924&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A06Z&v=2&sig=gCWrwfwgAI0mgFeZ7eNHvIil70Y2RRXDejw2f4Fj4rA%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>I</b><b>n this culmination of five decades of acclaimed studies in presidential history, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin offers an illuminating exploration of the early development, growth, and exercise of leadership.</b><BR><BR>Are leaders born or made?

Then, they discuss the nature of policy analysis and its practice and show students how to employ evaluative criteria in six substantive policy areas.

Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to <i>Fortune</i> magazine. Dalio himself has been named to <i>Time </i>magazine s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.

He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating baseball cards for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions.

Jobs retired at the end of August and died about six weeks later. Now, just weeks after his death, you can open the book that bears his name and read about his youth, his promise, and his relentless press to succeed. But the initial sadness in starting the book is soon replaced by something else, which is the intensity of the read--mirroring the intensity of Jobs’s focus and vision for his products. Few in history have transformed their time like Steve Jobs, and one could argue that he stands with the Fords, Edisons, and Gutenbergs of the world. This is a timely and complete portrait that pulls no punches and gives insight into a man whose contradictions were in many ways his greatest strength. <em>--Chris Schluep</em><br/> <br/> <br/> <p><span class=\"h1\"><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&A with Walter Isaacson </strong></span><br /><span class=\"h1\"><strong> </strong></span><img height=\"300\" src=\" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/SIMON/IsaacsonWalter._V164348457_.jpg\" style=\"float: right;\" width=\"450\" /></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> It's becoming well known that Jobs was able to create his Reality Distortion Field when it served him. Was it difficult for you to cut through the RDF and get beneath the narrative that he created? How did you do it? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Steve on the original Macintosh team, said that even if you were aware of his Reality Distortion Field, you still got caught up in it. But that is why Steve was so successful: He willfully bent reality so that you became convinced you could do the impossible, so you did. I never felt he was intentionally misleading me, but I did try to check every story. I did more than a hundred interviews. And he urged me not just to hear his version, but to interview as many people as possible. It was one of his many odd contradictions: He could distort reality, yet he was also brutally honest most of the time. He impressed upon me the value of honesty, rather than trying to whitewash things.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How were the interviews with Jobs conducted? Did you ask lots of questions, or did he just talk? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> I asked very few questions. We would take long walks or drives, or sit in his garden, and I would raise a topic and let him expound on it. Even during the more formal sessions in his living room, I would just sit quietly and listen. He loved to tell stories, and he would get very emotional, especially when talking about people in his life whom he admired or disdained.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He was a powerful man who could hold a grudge. Was it easy to get others to talk about Jobs willingly? Were they afraid to talk? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Everyone was eager to talk about Steve. They all had stories to tell, and they loved to tell them. Even those who told me about his rough manner put it in the context of how inspiring he could be.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jobs embraced the counterculture and Buddhism. Yet he was a billionaire businessman with his own jet. In what way did Jobs' contradictions contribute to his success?</p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Steve was filled with contradictions. He was a counterculture rebel who became a billionaire. He eschewed material objects yet made objects of desire. He talked, at times, about how he wrestled with these contradictions. His counterculture background combined with his love of electronics and business was key to the products he created. They combined artistry and technology. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jobs could be notoriously difficult. Did you wind up liking him in the end? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Yes, I liked him and was inspired by him. But I knew he could be unkind and rough. These things can go together. When my book first came out, some people skimmed it quickly and cherry-picked the examples of his being rude to people. But that was only half the story. Fortunately, as people read the whole book, they saw the theme of the narrative: He could be petulant and rough, but this was driven by his passion and pursuit of perfection. He liked people to stand up to him, and he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team. And the teams he built became extremely loyal and inspired. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you believe he was a genius? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He was a genius at connecting art to technology, of making leaps based on intuition and imagination. He knew how to make emotional connections with those around him and with his customers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did he have regrets? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He had some regrets, which he expressed in his interviews. For example, he said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend. But he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at Apple and the loyalty of both his close colleagues and his family.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think is his legacy?</p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> His legacy is transforming seven industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores. His legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth, one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now.

To write this biography Isaacson immersed himself in da Vinci’s 7,200 pages of notebooks, which these days are spread across the map. Da Vinci’s interests were even more divergent, and Isaacson’s empathetic and deeply researched portrait illustrates how he willed himself to genius through endless curiosity and a creativity that sometimes crossed over into fantasy. Much like Isaacson’s previous subjects of Ben Franklin and Steve Jobs, da Vinci was a polymath-- he was passionate about art, science, nature, and technology, and he never stopped questioning, practicing, or experimenting. This is what made him the great innovator and historical figure that we recognize today—and Isaacson points out that this is a particular form of genius that can teach us how to live our own lives. <em>-- Chris Schluep, Amazon Book Review</em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Artists, Architects & Photographers","id":"2329"},{"name":"United States","id":"2395"},{"name":"Italy","id":"9692512011"},{"name":"Scientists","id":"2426"},{"name":"Humor & Entertainment","id":"86"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Walter Isaacson","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781501139154","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781501139154"},"Edition":"1st Edition","Feature":"Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo's astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science.

Acclaimed technologist and inventor Amir Husain explains how we can live amidst the coming age of sentient machines and artificial intelligence—and not only survive, but thrive.</b><BR><BR>Artificial “machine” intelligence is playing an ever-greater role in our society. We are already using cruise control in our cars, automatic checkout at the drugstore, and are unable to live without our smartphones. The discussion around AI is polarized; people think either machines will solve all problems for everyone, or they will lead us down a dark, dystopian path into total human irrelevance. Regardless of what you believe, the idea that we might bring forth intelligent creation can be intrinsically frightening. But what if our greatest role as humans so far is that of creators?<BR> <BR>Amir Husain, a brilliant inventor and computer scientist, argues that we are on the cusp of writing our next, and greatest, creation myth. It is the dawn of a new form of intellectual diversity, one that we need to embrace in order to advance the state of the art in many critical fields, including security, resource management, finance, and energy. “In <i>The Sentient Machine</i>, Husain prepares us for a brighter future; not with hyperbole about right and wrong, but with serious arguments about risk and potential” (Dr. Greg Hyslop, Chief Technology Officer, The Boeing Company). He addresses broad existential questions surrounding the coming of AI: Why are we valuable? What can we create in this world? How are we intelligent? What constitutes progress for us? And how might we fail to progress? Husain boils down complex computer science and AI concepts into clear, plainspoken language and draws from a wide variety of cultural and historical references to illustrate his points.

Yet as federal entitlement programs have grown, so too have their inefficiency and their cost. Neither tax revenues nor revenues generated by the national economy have been able to keep pace with their rising growth, bringing the national debt to a record peacetime level.</p> <p><i>The High Cost of Good Intentions</i> is the first comprehensive history of these federal entitlement programs. Combining economics, history, political science, and law, John F. Cogan reveals how the creation of entitlements brings forth a steady march of liberalizing forces that cause entitlement programs to expand. This process―as visible in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as in the present day―is repeated until benefits are extended to nearly all who could be considered eligible, and in turn establishes a new base for future expansions. His work provides a unifying explanation for the evolutionary path that nearly all federal entitlement programs have followed over the past two hundred years, tracing both their shared past and the financial risks they pose for future generations.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economic Policy & Development","id":"2588"},{"name":"United States","id":"4853"},{"name":"History & Theory","id":"11086"},{"name":"Social Services & Welfare","id":"10580"},{"name":"Social Policy","id":"10771"},{"name":"Social Security","id":"11115"},{"name":"Economic Policy","id":"5571278011"},{"name":"Political History","id":"491472"},{"name":"Public Policy","id":"491474"}],"attributes":{"Author":"John F.

Description","content":"The Will to Power (German: Der Wille zur Macht) is a book of notes drawn from the literary remains of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche by his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche and Peter Gast (Heinrich Köselitz). The title derived from a work that Nietzsche himself had considered writing. After Nietzsche's breakdown in 1889, and the passing of control over his literary estate to his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, Nietzsche's friend Heinrich Köselitz, also known as Peter Gast, conceived the notion of publishing selections from his notebooks, using one of Nietzsche's simpler outlines as a guide to their arrangement. As he explained to Elisabeth on November 8, 1893: “Given that the original title appears as: The Antichrist. Revaluation of All Values (and therefore not 'The first book of the revaluation of all values'), you may think that your brother at the time of his incipient madness, thought the book completed. ... Notwithstanding, the consequences of this revaluation must also be explicitly illustrated in the field of morality, philosophy, politics. No one today is able to imagine such consequences – that's why the vast preparations by your brother, the other three books of the Revaluation, must be ordered according to my suggestion and gathered in a kind of system.” Between 1894 and 1926, Elisabeth arranged the publication of the twenty volume Großoktavausgabe edition of Nietzsche's writings by C. G. Naumann. In it, following Köselitz' suggestion she included a selection from Nietzsche's posthumous fragments, which was gathered together and entitled The Will To Power. She claimed that this text was substantially the magnum opus, which Nietzsche had hoped to write and name \"The Will to Power, An Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values\". The first German edition, containing 483 sections, published in 1901, was edited by Köselitz, Ernst Horneffer, and August Horneffer, under Elisabeth's direction. This version was superseded in 1906 by an expanded second edition containing 1067 sections. This later compilation is what has come to be commonly known as The Will to Power."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Modern","id":"11057"},{"name":"Religious","id":"11072"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781522045472","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781522045472"},"IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1522045473","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"42"},"Label":"Independently published","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"699","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$6.99"},"Manufacturer":"Independently published","NumberOfPages":"165","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"59","Length":"890","Weight":"55","Width":"610"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-08-07","Publisher":"Independently published","Studio":"Independently published","Title":"The Will to Power"}}}},{"id":"1524760064","data":{"width":54,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1699,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.99"},"asin":"1524760064","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Billionaire-Raj-Journey-Through-Indias/dp/1524760064?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1524760064","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Billionaire-Raj-Journey-Through-Indias/dp/1524760064?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1524760064","salesRank":13290,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RCh7gNo9L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"108"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RCh7gNo9L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"338"},"title":"The Billionaire Raj: A Journey Through India's New Gilded Age","similar":["031643650X","1732265100","1732265135","1250170583","0241335973","152473165X","1324002646","0670024937","0691161887","0307961737"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1524760064&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A04Z&v=2&sig=hArp435f5bCJG0Cqmjv53B%252FSkPfWSoLvHi1cQjg4XQc%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>A colorful and revealing portrait of the rise of India’s new billionaire class in a radically unequal society</b> <br><br> India is the world’s largest democracy, with more than one billion people and an economy expanding faster than China’s.

At the same time, millions of Indians live in poverty, sometimes subsisting just feet from the fancy, almost unimaginable urban homes of the super-rich. James Crabtree uses the home of the reclusive billionaire Mukesh Ambani (that is his home on the cover) as a symbol of an Indian system that Crabtree likens—quite convincingly—to our own Gilded Age. Like in other places around the world, fair government appears to be no match against the vast sums of private capital that the “Bollygarchs” employ to cement their interests. Crabtree uses interviews and riveting reporting to give us a fascinating look into the sudden, sometimes shocking, and seemingly insurmountable rise of the Indian super-elite, as they surf the wave of globalism. <em>–Chris Schluep, Amazon Book Review</em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economic Conditions","id":"2587"},{"name":"Income Inequality","id":"9147391011"},{"name":"India","id":"4895"},{"name":"Globalization","id":"3049191"}],"attributes":{"Author":"James Crabtree","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781524760069","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781524760069"},"ISBN":"1524760064","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"953","Length":"649","Width":"131"},"Label":"Tim Duggan Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Tim Duggan Books","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"416","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"138","Length":"949","Weight":"159","Width":"646"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-07-03","Publisher":"Tim Duggan Books","ReleaseDate":"2018-07-03","Studio":"Tim Duggan Books","Title":"The Billionaire Raj: A Journey Through India's New Gilded Age"}}}},{"id":"1538113368","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2116,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$21.16"},"asin":"1538113368","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Under-Fire-Reporting-Front-Lines/dp/1538113368?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1538113368","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Under-Fire-Reporting-Front-Lines/dp/1538113368?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1538113368","salesRank":3079,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DDKVevsmL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DDKVevsmL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Under Fire: Reporting from the Front Lines of the Trump White House","similar":["198210970X","1501175513","0062803700","1982103124","1524763136","0316421820","0316484814","1538106639","1442238410","125030119X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1538113368&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A30Z&v=2&sig=SfNF9QTnlJ6jYfrv%252B26OhZfqBPauj%252BYjCE96y3CA66g%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<span><span>Veteran White House reporter April Ryan thought she had seen everything in her two decades as a White House correspondent.

It is this tradition we must restore, he argues, if we want to limit conflict and hate--and allow human difference and innovation to flourish.</div></div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Israel & Palestine","id":"5001"},{"name":"Political","id":"11065"},{"name":"Nationalism","id":"271628011"},{"name":"Diplomacy","id":"1196144"},{"name":"Middle Eastern","id":"5571272011"},{"name":"Political Freedom","id":"3049211"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Yoram Hazony","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781541645370","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781541645370"},"ISBN":"1541645375","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"950","Length":"638","Width":"100"},"Label":"Basic Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Basic Books","NumberOfPages":"304","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"950","Weight":"112","Width":"638"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-09-04","Publisher":"Basic Books","ReleaseDate":"2018-09-04","Studio":"Basic Books","Title":"The Virtue of Nationalism"}}}},{"id":"1547195010","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":699,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$6.99"},"asin":"1547195010","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Summary-Homo-Deus-Takeaways-Analysis/dp/1547195010?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1547195010","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Summary-Homo-Deus-Takeaways-Analysis/dp/1547195010?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1547195010","salesRank":501698,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51imkojCxnL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51imkojCxnL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Summary of Homo Deus: Includes Key Takeaways & Analysis","similar":["1539485951","0062464310","1784703931","0525512179","0062316095","0062316117","1101982586","0525427570","0393609391","0143110373"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1547195010&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A04Z&v=2&sig=uJOMXqHjDJAb0%252BZ3jGUoZSu3CZYEva68Qfh8Kak2Rz4%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<em>PLEASE NOTE:</em> This is a summary, analysis and review of the book and not the original book. <br><br> In his New York Times bestselling book, Harari breaks down the path of humanism, humanity and offers an often bleak look at what the human race can expect in the future. <i>Homo Deus</i> is a truly earth-shattering look at the future of humanity. <br><br> This <b>FastReads Summary & Analysis</b> offers supplementary material to <i>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</i> to help you distill the key takeaways, review the book's content, and further understand the writing style and overall themes from an editorial perspective.

This book will shake the reader’s world view and prompt one to not only re-consider her relationship with technology, but also to think critically about narratives of human history. <i>Homo Deus</i> challenges the most fundamental questions of what it means to be human and implores readers to contemplate and take control of their futures before data does it for them. <br><br> <em>BEFORE YOU BUY:</em> The purpose of this <b>FastReads Summary</b> is to help you decide if it’s worth the time, money and effort reading the original book (if you haven’t already).

There are also new chapters on alternative medicine, which is now marketed in our drug stores, and on environmental pseudoscience, with special emphasis on the evidence that certain technologies like cell phones or environmental agents like asbestos cause cancer.<br><br>Finally, Hines discusses the psychological causes for belief in the paranormal despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Drawing on this and their 15 years of research from Chile to India, Kenya to Indonesia, they have identified wholly new aspects of the behavior of poor people, their needs, and the way that aid or financial investment can affect their lives. Their work defies certain presumptions: that microfinance is a cure-all, that schooling equals learning, that poverty at the level of 99 cents a day is just a more extreme version of the experience any of us have when our income falls uncomfortably low.</p><p>This important book illuminates how the poor live, and offers all of us an opportunity to think of a world beyond poverty.</p></div><p>Learn more at www.pooreconomics.com</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Development & Growth","id":"2585"},{"name":"Economics","id":"2594"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Poverty","id":"10576"},{"name":"Globalization","id":"3049191"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Abhijit Banerjee","Esther Duflo"],"Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Brand: Public Affairs","EAN":"9781586487980","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781586487980"},"Edition":"2nd Print","Feature":"Used Book in Good Condition","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1586487981","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"975","Length":"675","Weight":"128","Width":"125"},"Label":"PublicAffairs","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2699","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$26.99"},"Manufacturer":"PublicAffairs","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"320","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"134","Length":"921","Weight":"128","Width":"606"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2011-04-26","Publisher":"PublicAffairs","Studio":"PublicAffairs","Title":"Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty"}}}},{"id":"1590514882","data":{"width":56,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1580,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$15.80"},"asin":"1590514882","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Existentialist-Café-Cocktails-Jean-Paul-Merleau-Ponty/dp/1590514882?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1590514882","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Existentialist-Café-Cocktails-Jean-Paul-Merleau-Ponty/dp/1590514882?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1590514882","salesRank":81321,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512Oe1Y7%2BLL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"112"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512Oe1Y7%2BLL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"350"},"title":"At the Existentialist Café: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails with Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Others","similar":["1590514831","1631490710","0871404435","0385031386","0374154481","1590514254","0452009308","022624167X","1627790241","0393352986"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1590514882&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A14Z&v=2&sig=v0X5D12gjhugkBEfok3mPQvUEiRGrKKbpZIK14sXYjU%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>A <i>New York Times</i> \"Ten Best Books of 2016\"<br><br></b>From the best-selling author of <i>How to Live</i>, a spirited account of one of the twentieth century’s major intellectual movements and the revolutionary thinkers who came to shape it<br>  <br> Paris, 1933: three contemporaries meet over apricot cocktails at the Bec-de-Gaz bar on the rue Montparnasse.

Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, including more than 28 million who’ve watched his TED Talk based on START WITH WHY -- the third most popular TED video of all time.<br /> <br /> Sinek starts with a fundamental question: Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? <br /> <br /> People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. <br /> <br /> START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world all think, act, and communicate the same way -- and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired.

If you think that is too ambitious or wildly unrealistic, you need to read this book. His focus is on the one billion poorest individuals around the world who are caught in a poverty trap of disease, physical isolation, environmental stress, political instability, and lack of access to capital, technology, medicine, and education. The goal is to help these people reach the first rung on the \"ladder of economic development\" so they can rise above mere subsistence level and achieve some control over their economic futures and their lives. To do this, Sachs proposes nine specific steps, which he explains in great detail in <I>The End of Poverty</I>. Though his plan certainly requires the help of rich nations, the financial assistance Sachs calls for is surprisingly modest--more than is now provided, but within the bounds of what has been promised in the past. For the U.S., for instance, it would mean raising foreign aid from just 0.14 percent of GNP to 0.7 percent. Sachs does not view such help as a handout but rather an investment in global economic growth that will add to the security of all nations. In presenting his argument, he offers a comprehensive education on global economics, including why globalization should be embraced rather than fought, why international institutions such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank need to play a strong role in this effort, and the reasons why extreme poverty exists in the midst of great wealth. He also shatters some persistent myths about poor people and shows how developing nations can do more to help themselves.<p> Despite some crushing statistics, <I>The End of Poverty</I> is a hopeful book. Based on a tremendous amount of data and his own experiences working as an economic advisor to the UN and several individual nations, Sachs makes a strong moral, economic, and political case for why countries and individuals should battle poverty with the same commitment and focus normally reserved for waging war. This important book not only makes the end of poverty seem realistic, but in the best interest of everyone on the planet, rich and poor alike. --<I>Shawn Carkonen</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Development & Growth","id":"2585"},{"name":"Economic Conditions","id":"2587"},{"name":"Economic Policy & Development","id":"2588"},{"name":"Poverty","id":"10576"},{"name":"Globalization","id":"3049191"},{"name":"Political Economy","id":"5571263011"},{"name":"Economic Policy","id":"5571278011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jeffrey D.

But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research.<br><br>A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, <i>How to Change Your Mind</i> is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan's \"mental travelogue\" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2018:</strong> Michael Pollan, whose curiosity about our eating habits led to thoughtful, culturally transformative writing in <em>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</em> and, most recently, <em>Food Rules</em>, here explores the potential psilocybin and other psychedelics hold for transformation of the spiritual and emotional kind. As he tells it in <em>How to Change Your Mind</em>, a fascinating, sometimes moving look at the history and uses of psychoactive compounds, Pollan avoided such drugs in his youth, but later in life became intrigued by the opportunity “to become more ‘open’—especially at this age, when the grooves of mental habit have been etched so deep as to seem inescapable.” And then there was the chance of experiencing a spiritual epiphany—“touching the face of God,” as one ecstatic user put it. Pollan’s natural skepticism and wry humor is a good match for the detailed accounts he includes of mind-blowing, trip-induced revelations. Ultimately, whether such experiences lead to genuine insight into, say, the origins of the universe or what we can expect after death seems less interesting to Pollan than the hope psychedelics offer people suffering from depression, addiction, and acute illness. Can magic mushrooms be used more broadly for “the betterment of well people”? Readers who begin reading Pollan’s book feeling doubtful about the responsible use of psychedelics may find their own minds changed by his engaging, enlightened, and persuasive combination of personal and journalistic research. “I felt as if I were standing on the edge of a wide-open frontier, squinting to make out something wondrous,” he writes, and with him as our guide, so do we. <em>—Sarah Harrison Smith, Amazon Book Review</em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Scientists","id":"2426"},{"name":"Mental Health","id":"4682"},{"name":"New Age & Spirituality","id":"12621"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","id":"265547"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Michael Pollan","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781594204227","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781594204227"},"ISBN":"1594204225","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"952","Length":"650","Weight":"166","Width":"136"},"Label":"Penguin Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Penguin Press","MPN":"50451055","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"480","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"150","Length":"930","Weight":"170","Width":"640"},"PartNumber":"50451055","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-05-15","Publisher":"Penguin Press","ReleaseDate":"2018-05-15","Studio":"Penguin Press","Title":"How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence"}}}},{"id":"1594205221","data":{"width":54,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1247,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$12.47"},"asin":"1594205221","link":"https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical/dp/1594205221?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1594205221","url":"https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical/dp/1594205221?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1594205221","salesRank":35035,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/318BW%2BUmr9L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"108"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/318BW%2BUmr9L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"336"},"title":"How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking","similar":["1627790365","159420411X","0393088812","0374275637","159420229X","0062316095","0465027660","0393080943","1119000602","0804136696"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1594205221&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A11Z&v=2&sig=QhgTq4ScHzSZdutKAdYrEUfawIARlSpilYhPNXDyH74%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>The <i>Freakonomics </i>of math</b>--<b>a math-world superstar unveils the hidden beauty and logic of the world and puts its power in our hands</b><br><br>The math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned.

[a] magisterial new book.”</b><br><br>Henry Kissinger offers in <i>World Order</i> a deep meditation on the roots of international harmony and global disorder. Drawing on his experience as one of the foremost statesmen of the modern era—advising presidents, traveling the world, observing and shaping the central foreign policy events of recent decades—Kissinger now reveals his analysis of the ultimate challenge for the twenty-first century: how to build a shared international order in a world of divergent historical perspectives, violent conflict, proliferating technology, and ideological extremism.<br><br>There has never been a true “world order,” Kissinger observes. For most of history, civilizations defined their own concepts of order. Each considered itself the center of the world and envisioned its distinct principles as universally relevant. China conceived of a global cultural hierarchy with the Emperor at its pinnacle. In Europe, Rome imagined itself surrounded by barbarians; when Rome fragmented, European peoples refined a concept of an equilibrium of sovereign states and sought to export it across the world. Islam, in its early centuries, considered itself the world’s sole legitimate political unit, destined to expand indefinitely until the world was brought into harmony by religious principles. The United States was born of a conviction about the universal applicability of democracy—a conviction that has guided its policies ever since.<br><br>Now international affairs take place on a global basis, and these historical concepts of world order are meeting. Every region participates in questions of high policy in every other, often instantaneously. Yet there is no consensus among the major actors about the rules and limits guiding this process, or its ultimate destination. The result is mounting tension.<br><br>Grounded in Kissinger’s deep study of history and his experience as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, <i>World Order</i> guides readers through crucial episodes in recent world history. Kissinger offers a unique glimpse into the inner deliberations of the Nixon administration’s negotiations with Hanoi over the end of the Vietnam War, as well as Ronald Reagan’s tense debates with Soviet Premier Gorbachev in Reykjavík.

Why does cancer develop? What's the connection between heart failure and Alzheimer's disease, or infertility and hearing loss? Can we extend lifespan, and if so, how? What is the Exercise Paradox? Why do antioxidant supplements sometimes do more harm than good? Many will be amazed to learn that all these questions, and many more, can be answered by a single point of discussion: mitochondria and bioenergetics.</p> <p>In <em>Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine</em>, Naturopathic Doctor Lee Know tells the epic story of mitochondria, the widely misunderstood and often-overlooked powerhouses of our cells. The legendary saga began over two billion years ago, when one bacterium entered another without being digested, which would evolve to create the first mitochondrion. Since then, for life to exist beyond single-celled bacteria, it's the mitochondria that have been responsible for this life-giving energy. By understanding how our mitochondria work, in fact, it is possible to add years to our lives, and life to our years.</p> <p>Current research, however, has revealed a dark side: many seemingly disconnected degenerative diseases have tangled roots in dysfunctional mitochondria. However, modern research has also endowed us with the knowledge on how to optimize its function, which is of critical importance to our health and longevity. Lee Know offers cutting-edge information on supplementation and lifestyle changes for mitochondrial optimization, such as CoQ10, D-Ribose, cannabinoids, and ketogenic dietary therapy, and how to implement their use successfully. <em>Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine</em> is an invaluable resource for practitioners interested in mitochondrial medicine and the true roots of chronic illness and disease, as well as anyone interested in optimizing their health.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Holistic","id":"4704"},{"name":"Longevity","id":"11764645011"},{"name":"Cell Biology","id":"13524"},{"name":"Microbiology","id":"172406"},{"name":"Holistic Medicine","id":"689700011"},{"name":"Biology & Life Sciences","id":"491702"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Lee Know","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781603587679","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781603587679"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"1603587675","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"902","Length":"602","Width":"79"},"Label":"Chelsea Green Publishing","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2495","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$24.95"},"Manufacturer":"Chelsea Green Publishing","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"272","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"94","Length":"890","Weight":"93","Width":"598"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-02-28","Publisher":"Chelsea Green Publishing","Studio":"Chelsea Green Publishing","Title":"Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine: The Key to Understanding Disease, Chronic Illness, Aging, and Life Itself"}}}},{"id":"1603843051","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1334,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$13.34"},"asin":"1603843051","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Presocratics-Reader-Selected-Fragments-Testimonia/dp/1603843051?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1603843051","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Presocratics-Reader-Selected-Fragments-Testimonia/dp/1603843051?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1603843051","salesRank":9529,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CHEAJ5vcL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CHEAJ5vcL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"324"},"title":"A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia (Hackett Classics)","similar":["0375757996","0872203395","0872203492","0915145677","1603848118","0872206335","0199540616","0872201368","0872202321","0872203786"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1603843051&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A18Z&v=2&sig=5jIxbOalOpLiaL1onOKH%252F65fJUluT0WXr2fy%252BK8lcSk%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<DIV><P>Building on the virtues that made the first edition of <I>A Presocratics Reader</I> the most widely used sourcebook for the study of the Presocratics and Sophists, the second edition offers even more value and a wider selection of fragments from these philosophical predecessors and contemporaries of Socrates.</P><P>With revised introductions, annotations, suggestions for further reading, and more, the second edition draws on the wealth of new scholarship published on these fascinating thinkers over the past decade or more, a remarkably rich period in Presocratic studies.</P><P>At the volume's core, as ever, are the fragments themselves--but now in thoroughly revised and, in some cases, new translations by Richard D.

Yet every year, recovery from droughts and floods costs billions of dollars, and we spend billions more on dams, diversions, levees, and other feats of engineering. These massive projects not only are risky financially and environmentally, they often threaten social and political stability. What if the answer was not further control of the water cycle, but repair and replenishment?<BR /><BR /> Sandra Postel takes readers around the world to explore water projects that work with, rather than against, nature’s rhythms. In New Mexico, forest rehabilitation is safeguarding drinking water; along the Mississippi River, farmers are planting cover crops to reduce polluted runoff; and in China, “sponge cities” are capturing rainwater to curb urban flooding.<BR /><BR /> Efforts like these will be essential as climate change disrupts both weather patterns and the models on which we base our infrastructure. We will be forced to adapt. The question is whether we will continue to fight the water cycle or recognize our place in it and take advantage of the inherent services nature offers. Water, Postel writes, is a gift, the source of life itself.

But, as Rutherford points out in his intriguing exploration of humankind, DNA tests offer only a sensationalized peek at our roots, and the tangled, still-evolving truth is far more fascinating. Armed with his disarming British wit, Rutherford delves into the migration, interbreeding and isolation, and extinction of hominid branches that has shaped the modern human. Holes in our fossil record and the lack of DNA in fossils we’ve actually found still make genome research a challenge, yet the more we learn, the more we have to change our perception of who Homo sapiens are and what we’re made of. Challenging the simplistic thinking bolstered by the media, Rutherford adds both nuance and the thrill of excitement to viewing our species through a wider, stronger lens that can now see deep into our past. <em>—Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review </em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Genealogy","id":"11880"},{"name":"Genetics","id":"13535"},{"name":"Anatomy","id":"227595"},{"name":"Cultural","id":"11235"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Adam Rutherford","Binding":"Hardcover","Creator":"Siddhartha Mukherjee","EAN":"9781615194049","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781615194049"},"ISBN":"1615194045","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Weight":"70","Width":"125"},"Label":"The Experiment","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2595","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$25.95"},"Manufacturer":"The Experiment","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"416","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"150","Length":"902","Weight":"70","Width":"598"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-10-03","Publisher":"The Experiment","Studio":"The Experiment","Title":"A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes"}}}},{"id":"1617292230","data":{"width":64,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1827,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$18.27"},"asin":"1617292230","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1617292230","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1617292230","salesRank":9104,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uUPXbhMxL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"128"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uUPXbhMxL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"399"},"title":"Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people","similar":["0262036630","1680502441","0997316020","0984782850","1537713949","0999282905","1593274246","1617292397","0134494164","0132350882"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1617292230&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A11Z&v=2&sig=w2wA4Tirkn7fjWBGhtIuagKazxbZ%252FW5xQb6X2%252BVFJ6k%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><p><b>Summary</b></p> <p/><p><i>Grokking Algorithms</i> is a fully illustrated, friendly guide that teaches you how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face every day as a programmer.

That’s a question bound up in another: What do you think you are? Gender. Religion. Race. Nationality. Class. Culture. Such affiliations give contours to our sense of self, and shape our polarized world. Yet the collective identities they spawn are riddled with contradictions, and cratered with falsehoods.</p><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah’s <em>The Lies That Bind</em> is an incandescent exploration of the nature and history of the identities that define us. It challenges our assumptions about how identities work. We all know there are conflicts between identities, but Appiah shows how identities are created by conflict. Religion, he demonstrates, gains power because it isn’t primarily about belief. Our everyday notions of race are the detritus of discarded nineteenth-century science. Our cherished concept of the sovereign nation―of self-rule―is incoherent and unstable. Class systems can become entrenched by efforts to reform them. Even the very idea of Western culture is a shimmering mirage.</p><p>From Anton Wilhelm Amo, the eighteenth-century African child who miraculously became an eminent European philosopher before retiring back to Africa, to Italo Svevo, the literary marvel who changed citizenship without leaving home, to Appiah’s own father, Joseph, an anticolonial firebrand who was ready to give his life for a nation that did not yet exist, Appiah interweaves keen-edged argument with vibrant narratives to expose the myths behind our collective identities.</p><p>These “mistaken identities,” Appiah explains, can fuel some of our worst atrocities―from chattel slavery to genocide. And yet, he argues that social identities aren’t something we can simply do away with. They can usher in moral progress and bring significance to our lives by connecting the small scale of our daily existence with larger movements, causes, and concerns.</p><p>Elaborating a bold and clarifying new theory of identity, <em>The Lies That Bind</em> is a ringing philosophical statement for the anxious, conflict-ridden twenty-first century.

But facing the sea change that AI will bring can be paralyzing. How should companies set strategies, governments design policies, and people plan their lives for a world so different from what we know? In the face of such uncertainty, many analysts either cower in fear or predict an impossibly sunny future.</p><p>But in <i>Prediction Machines</i>, three eminent economists recast the rise of AI as a drop in the cost of prediction. With this single, masterful stroke, they lift the curtain on the AI-is-magic hype and show how basic tools from economics provide clarity about the AI revolution and a basis for action by CEOs, managers, policy makers, investors, and entrepreneurs.</p><p>When AI is framed as cheap prediction, its extraordinary potential becomes clear:<ul><li>Prediction is at the heart of making decisions under uncertainty. Our businesses and personal lives are riddled with such decisions.<li>Prediction tools increase productivity--operating machines, handling documents, communicating with customers.<li>Uncertainty constrains strategy. Better prediction creates opportunities for new business structures and strategies to compete.</ul></p><p>Penetrating, fun, and always insightful and practical, <i>Prediction Machines</i> follows its inescapable logic to explain how to navigate the changes on the horizon. The impact of AI will be profound, but the economic framework for understanding it is surprisingly simple.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economics","id":"2581"},{"name":"Computers & Technology","id":"886498"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategy & Competition","id":"2553"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"},{"name":"Intelligence & Semantics","id":"280291"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Ajay Agrawal","Joshua Gans","Avi Goldfarb"],"Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781633695672","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781633695672"},"ISBN":"1633695670","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"950","Length":"625","Width":"75"},"Label":"Harvard Business Review Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Harvard Business Review Press","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"272","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"98","Length":"945","Weight":"108","Width":"642"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-04-17","Publisher":"Harvard Business Review Press","ReleaseDate":"2018-04-17","Studio":"Harvard Business Review Press","Title":"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence"}}}},{"id":"1640320164","data":{"width":50.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":811,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$8.11"},"asin":"1640320164","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Chump-Change/dp/1640320164?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1640320164","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Chump-Change/dp/1640320164?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1640320164","salesRank":19901,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ce6FAN0KL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"101"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ce6FAN0KL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"315"},"title":"The Art of War (Chump Change Edition)","similar":["1640320199","1590309847","1640320180","1844838021","1945644583","0140280197","0394555287","0857080776","1374857742","0857083139"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1640320164&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A22Z&v=2&sig=hYZ7n7Qqmcf8CJ8RFp5i2SDXf%252BQdNrYX4vQVPlZobhE%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>This<strong> <u>Unabridged</u></strong> English value reproduction of <strong><u>THE ART OF WAR</u></strong> is wisdom on competition from 2,500 years ago.  It lists the 13 Chapters in bare form for the reader to review and contemplate Sun Tzu’s teachings as it applies to their life.</p><p><strong><u>THE ART OF WAR</u></strong> is divided into 13 chapters covering all the steps of battle, be it in the office or across continents.  Topics include, “Five Essentials for Victory,” “Tactical Dispositions,” “Maneuvering,” and many more.  </p><p>No student of influence should be without this historic philosophy book on leadership.

It was first published in 1886.</p><p>In <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm \"beyond good and evil\" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.  Source: Wikipedia</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Motivational","id":"4744"},{"name":"German","id":"10412"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Ethics & Morality","id":"11037"},{"name":"Good & Evil","id":"11045"},{"name":"Metaphysics","id":"11055"},{"name":"Education Theory","id":"69829"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","Binding":"Hardcover","Creator":"Helen Zimmern","EAN":"9781680921908","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781680921908"},"ISBN":"1680921908","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"921","Length":"614","Width":"38"},"Label":"12th Media Services","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1189","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$11.89"},"Manufacturer":"12th Media Services","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"102","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"55","Length":"929","Weight":"84","Width":"630"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-02-28","Publisher":"12th Media Services","Studio":"12th Media Services","Title":"Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future"}}}},{"id":"1717229840","data":{"width":50,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":699,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$6.99"},"asin":"1717229840","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Summary-Analysis-Factfulness-Reasons-World-/dp/1717229840?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1717229840","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Summary-Analysis-Factfulness-Reasons-World-/dp/1717229840?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1717229840","salesRank":155811,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pFoJ%2BTwXL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"100"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pFoJ%2BTwXL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"313"},"title":"Summary & Analysis of Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think | A Guide to the Book by Hans Rosling","similar":["1250107814","147363749X","1501175513","1987690370","0316392006","0451497899","0241338379","0399589813","1980942277","0231182252"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1717229840&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A17Z&v=2&sig=ahABL%252F%252BytpvYFW5DD%252FkPXVGfN4FgN%252Buhy9ORJwF%252BxuM%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> This is a summary and analysis of the book and not the original book.

Using decades, and sometimes centuries, of data, he systemically counters many common notions held today--that the world is more violent, that more people live in poverty, and that population growth is not truly exponential--to name a few. <br><br> <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This book is intended as a companion to, not a replacement for, <i>Factfulness.</i> ZIP Reads is wholly responsible for this content and is not associated with the original author in any way. <br><br> Please follow this link: https://amzn.to/2qfdagm to purchase a copy of the original book. <br><br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Book Notes","id":"10367768011"},{"name":"Test Prep & Study Guides","id":"684300011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"ZIP Reads","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781717229847","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781717229847"},"ISBN":"1717229840","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"800","Length":"500","Width":"10"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"699","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$6.99"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","NumberOfPages":"44","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"24","Length":"780","Weight":"13","Width":"488"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-04-22","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"Summary & Analysis of Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think | A Guide to the Book by Hans Rosling"}}}},{"id":"1717816339","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":587,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$5.87"},"asin":"1717816339","link":"https://www.amazon.com/SUMMARY-Factfulness-Reasons-World-Rosling/dp/1717816339?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1717816339","url":"https://www.amazon.com/SUMMARY-Factfulness-Reasons-World-Rosling/dp/1717816339?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1717816339","salesRank":60304,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2Bmxux6JZL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2Bmxux6JZL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"SUMMARY Of Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think By Hans Rosling","similar":["1250107814","147363749X","0062316117","147673352X","1501139150","1400032717","1400067219"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1717816339&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A03Z&v=2&sig=rDpV6S8ceNleGAPBtLWcu%252FSCvKK%252F8GcMzGdxixdLKWk%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<h2><b>SUMMARY Of Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think By Hans Rosling, Anna Rosling Rönnlund and Ola Rosling | Book Summary | Trey Study Guide</b></h2> Ever wondered why the world appears gloomy most of the time? <br></br> In the book, <b>“Factfulness: Ten reasons we’re wrong about the world – And why things are better than you think”</b> Hans Rosling- in conjunction with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Rönnlund- discusses 10 instincts that have so far succeeded in twisting our view of the world.

Where will its impacts be most deeply felt? Are we doing enough to protect ourselves from the coming chaos? In <i>Extreme Cities</i>, Ashley Dawson argues that cities are ground zero for climate change, contributing the lion’s share of carbon to the atmosphere, while also lying on the frontlines of rising sea levels. Today, the majority of the world’s megacities are located in coastal zones, yet few of them are adequately prepared for the floods that will increasingly menace their shores. Instead, most continue to develop luxury waterfront condos for the elite and industrial facilities for corporations. These not only intensify carbon emissions, but also place coastal residents at greater risk when water levels rise.<br><br> In <i>Extreme Cities</i>, Dawson offers an alarming portrait of the future of our cities, describing the efforts of Staten Island, New York, and Shishmareff, Alaska residents to relocate; Holland’s models for defending against the seas; and the development of New York City before and after Hurricane Sandy. Our best hope lies not with fortified sea walls, he argues. Rather, it lies with urban movements already fighting to remake our cities in a more just and equitable way.<br><br> As much a harrowing study as a call to arms <i>Extreme Cities</i> is a necessary read for anyone concerned with the threat of global warming, and of the cities of the world."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Environmental","id":"13735"},{"name":"Climatology","id":"16053231"},{"name":"Environmental Science","id":"13598"},{"name":"Evolution","id":"13824"},{"name":"Conservation","id":"290062"},{"name":"Environmentalism","id":"290441"},{"name":"Cultural","id":"11235"},{"name":"Urban","id":"11296"},{"name":"Radicalism","id":"11091"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Ashley Dawson","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Verso","EAN":"9781784780364","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781784780364"},"Feature":"Verso","ISBN":"1784780367","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"952","Length":"645","Weight":"125","Width":"130"},"Label":"Verso","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.95"},"Manufacturer":"Verso","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"384","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"79","Length":"917","Weight":"114","Width":"606"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-10-17","Publisher":"Verso","ReleaseDate":"2017-10-17","Studio":"Verso","Title":"Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change"}}}},{"id":"1786070650","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1087,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$10.87"},"asin":"1786070650","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Progress-Reasons-Look-Forward-Future/dp/1786070650?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1786070650","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Progress-Reasons-Look-Forward-Future/dp/1786070650?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1786070650","salesRank":38447,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41y3E%2BMUbTL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41y3E%2BMUbTL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"326"},"title":"Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future","similar":["0061452068","161039741X","1930865473","0525427570","0465097626","0143110373","0312541198","1594634793","1250107814","0241337011"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1786070650&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A17Z&v=2&sig=5y9M1zm4jUoBbWVHDmqyjDogZrVTZuUqVuOwGwouJLY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>A Book of the Year for The Economist and the Observer</b><BR> Our world seems to be collapsing.

In the face of fear-mongering, darkness and division, the facts are unequivocal: the golden age is now."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economic History","id":"2589"},{"name":"Statistics","id":"10020691011"},{"name":"World","id":"5035"},{"name":"Technology","id":"14631"},{"name":"Customs & Traditions","id":"11244"},{"name":"Cultural","id":"11235"},{"name":"General","id":"11237"},{"name":"Politics & Government","id":"5571255011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Johan Norberg","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781786070654","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781786070654"},"Edition":"First Trade Paper","ISBN":"1786070650","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"775","Length":"500","Weight":"53","Width":"75"},"Label":"Oneworld Publications","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1599","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$15.99"},"Manufacturer":"Oneworld Publications","MPN":"45719456","NumberOfPages":"288","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"94","Length":"772","Weight":"53","Width":"504"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"45719456","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-07-11","Publisher":"Oneworld Publications","Studio":"Oneworld Publications","Title":"Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future"}}}},{"id":"1843430851","data":{"width":50,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2070,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$20.70"},"asin":"1843430851","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Gulag-Archipelago-Aleksandr-Solzhenitsyn/dp/1843430851?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1843430851","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Gulag-Archipelago-Aleksandr-Solzhenitsyn/dp/1843430851?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1843430851","salesRank":10841,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41zp0BW9o1L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"100"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41zp0BW9o1L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"314"},"title":"The Gulag Archipelago","similar":["0415922224","0062303023","0345816021","0374513341","0156612062","1503250881","0156767503","0486415872","0451228146","1878923145"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1843430851&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A24Z&v=2&sig=I69dttXuXxi9Ve%252FcaIxBLcvMJn60z%252BerWh%252FR8SL%252BPI8%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"The Gulag Archipelago is Solzhenitsyn's masterwork, a vast canvas of camps, prisons, transit centres and secret police, of informers and spies and interrogators and also of heroism, a Stalinist anti-world at the heart of the Soviet Union where the key to survival lay not in hope but in despair.

In this brilliant and ambitious book, Mike Davis explores the future of a radically unequal and explosively unstable urban world. From the sprawling barricadas of Lima to the garbage hills of Manila, urbanization has been disconnected from industrialization, and even from economic growth. Davis portrays a vast humanity warehoused in shantytowns and exiled from the formal world economy. He argues that the rise of this informal urban proletariat is a wholly unforeseen development, and asks whether the great slums, as a terrified Victorian middle class once imagined, are volcanoes waiting to erupt."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Commercial Policy","id":"2582"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Urban Planning &

If you’ve ever wondered about the purpose sleep serves in our lives, this is a must read! We know a lot about why and how eating, hydrating, and reproducing are necessities; however, sleep has never been well researched and explained. Matthew Walker does a great job telling us exactly why sleep is so important in his book Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams. <br /> Proper rest and sleep allows us to think, learn, make rational and logical decisions. It further resets our emotions, desire to eat and drink, replenishes our immune system and aids our metabolism. Dreaming is our private brand of virtual reality where our brains remember our past, look ahead to our futures and add a good dose of the present to stimulate our creative juices. <br /> With Matthew Walker’s studies and insights, we’ll assess topics like: • The effects of alcohol and caffeine on our sleep. • REM and NREM sleep. • Sleep patterns over time. • How sleep impacts our health, moods, energy. • Are sleep aids valuable or harmful? • Can sleep prevent cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer’s? • Can sleep add years to our life and make us more efficient and successful? <br /> <b> And much more!

Weaving together anecdotal narratives and preliminary research on the use of small amounts of psychedelics, Microdosing Psychedelics is oriented toward anyone interested in microdosing to improve their general well-being, particularly those in leadership and creative positions. Over the last few years, microdosing has entered the cultural zeitgeist.

With reason, science, and humanism—the foundational principles of the Enlightenment—and our modern ways of measuring progress by way of data, Pinker elegantly proves that the world is in a better place than it used to be, and things will only keep getting better so long as we stay committed to those principles that have served us and still do. <br><br> <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This book is intended as a companion to, not a replacement for, <i>Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress.</i> ZIP Reads is wholly responsible for this content and is not associated with the original author in any way. <br><br> Please follow this link: https://amzn.to/2HjpAvg to purchase a copy of the original book. <br><br> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Book Notes","id":"10367768011"},{"name":"Test Prep & Study Guides","id":"684300011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"ZIP Reads","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781987690378","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781987690378"},"ISBN":"1987690370","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"800","Length":"500","Width":"14"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"799","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$7.99"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","NumberOfPages":"60","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"14","Length":"800","Weight":"26","Width":"500"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-04-11","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"Summary & Analysis of Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress | A Guide to the Book by Steven Pinker"}}}},{"id":"3319596349","data":{"width":60.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2849,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$28.49"},"asin":"3319596349","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Landscapes-Western-North-America/dp/3319596349?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=3319596349","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Landscapes-Western-North-America/dp/3319596349?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=3319596349","salesRank":43083,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515IcGCbvVL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"121"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515IcGCbvVL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"377"},"title":"Ancient Landscapes of Western North America: A Geologic History with Paleogeographic Maps","similar":["1604697628","0231182600","0878426817","0062490427","1934656038","0307908658","087842587X","0878426728","0878426779","0878426701"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=3319596349&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A12Z&v=2&sig=F6aFEn%252F89UVENmDEOPMWIJWQOGrjNCYlc5d6%252BrM2ZlA%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Allow yourself to be taken back into deep geologic time when strange creatures roamed the Earth and Western North America looked completely unlike the modern landscape.  Volcanic islands stretched from Mexico to Alaska, most of the Pacific Rim didn’t exist yet, at least not as widespread dry land; terranes drifted from across the Pacific to dock on Western Americas’ shores creating mountains and more volcanic activity.  Landscapes were transposed north or south by thousands of kilometers along huge fault systems.  Follow these events through paleogeographic maps that look like satellite views of ancient Earth.  Accompanying text takes the reader into the science behind these maps and the geologic history that they portray.  The maps and text unfold the complex geologic history of the region as never seen before."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Regional","id":"15959301"},{"name":"Geology","id":"13603"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","id":"491730"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Ronald C.

Even as students increasingly demand trigger warnings and “safe spaces,” many young people are quick to police the words and deeds of others, who in turn claim that political correctness has run amok. Interestingly, members of both camps often consider themselves victims of the other.

Among the biggest: <em>How did</em> Homo sapiens <em>(or</em> Homo sapiens sapiens <em>, if you’re feeling especially wise today) evolve from an unexceptional savannah-dwelling primate to become the dominant force on the planet, emerging as the lone survivor out of six distinct, competing hominid species?</em> He also has some answers, and they’re not what you’d expect. Tackling evolutionary concepts from a historian’s perspective, <em>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</em>, describes human development through a framework of three not-necessarily-orthodox “Revolutions”: the Cognitive, the Agricultural, and the Scientific. His ideas are interesting and often amusing: <em>Why have humans managed to build astonishingly large populations when other primate groups top out at 150 individuals?</em> Because our talent for gossip allows us to build networks in societies too large for personal relationships between everyone, and our universally accepted “imagined realities”--such as money, religion, and Limited Liability Corporations—keep us in line. <em>Who cultivated whom, humans or wheat?</em>. Wheat. Though the concepts are unusual and sometimes heavy (as is the book, literally) Harari’s deft prose and wry, subversive humor make quick work of material prone to academic tedium. He’s written a book of popular nonfiction (it was a bestseller overseas, no doubt in part because his conclusions draw controversy) landing somewhere in the middle of a Venn diagram of genetics, sociology, and history. Throughout, Harari returns frequently to another question: <em>Does all this progress make us happier, our lives easier?</em> The answer might disappoint you. --<em>Jon Foro</em></p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Civilization & Culture","id":"15812171"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","id":"13469"},{"name":"Evolution","id":"13824"},{"name":"General","id":"11237"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Yuval Noah Harari","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Harper","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"XM-0062316095"},"EAN":"9780062316097","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780062316097","0642688061623"]},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"Harper","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0062316095","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"170","Length":"890","Weight":"229","Width":"640"},"Label":"Harper","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$35.00"},"Manufacturer":"Harper","MPN":"22177058","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"464","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"170","Length":"910","Weight":"251","Width":"610"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"22177058","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2015-02-10","Publisher":"Harper","ReleaseDate":"2015-02-10","Studio":"Harper","Title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind","UPC":"642688061623","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"642688061623"}}}}},{"id":"0062464310","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1983,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$19.83"},"asin":"0062464310","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062464310","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062464310","salesRank":1324,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MJoxwmKfL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MJoxwmKfL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow","similar":["0062316095","0062316117","0525512179","0143117009","0393061310","0525427570","1101946598","1250107814","1400063515","0393354326"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0062464310&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A56Z&v=2&sig=U6JklM9fI%252F9FFePTkhOlTrIGKMEOyEDUHiqXxE6CIsI%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><strong><em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER </strong></p><p>Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and international phenomenon <em>Sapiens</em>, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.</p><strong></strong><p>Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war.

For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together.

Predicting the future isn’t as easy as deconstructing the past, and Harari openly admits the challenge—but even if he’s completely wrong in his predictions, and most of us doubt he is, <em>Homo Deus</em> is the kind of provocative, food-for-thought read that drew so many of us to his work in the first place.

Lays a foundation for understanding human history.\"―Bill Gates</strong></p> Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em> is a brilliant work answering the question of why the peoples of certain continents succeeded in invading other continents and conquering or displacing their peoples. This edition includes a new chapter on Japan and all-new illustrations drawn from the television series. Until around 11,000 BC, all peoples were still Stone Age hunter/gatherers. At that point, a great divide occurred in the rates that human societies evolved. In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, farming became the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals were domesticated by prehistoric planters and herders. As Jared Diamond vividly reveals, the very people who gained a head start in producing food would collide with preliterate cultures, shaping the modern world through conquest, displacement, and genocide.The paths that lead from scattered centers of food to broad bands of settlement had a great deal to do with climate and geography. But how did differences in societies arise? Why weren't native Australians, Americans, or Africans the ones to colonize Europe? Diamond dismantles pernicious racial theories tracing societal differences to biological differences. He assembles convincing evidence linking germs to domestication of animals, germs that Eurasians then spread in epidemic proportions in their voyages of discovery. In its sweep, <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em> encompasses the rise of agriculture, technology, writing, government, and religion, providing a unifying theory of human history as intriguing as the histories of dinosaurs and glaciers. 32 illustrations"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Military","id":"5011"},{"name":"Civilization & Culture","id":"15812171"},{"name":"Engineering","id":"173515"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Crop Science","id":"3048991"},{"name":"Evolution","id":"13824"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Human Geography","id":"11272"},{"name":"General","id":"11237"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jared Diamond Ph.D.","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"W W Norton Company","EAN":"9780393061314","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8580001044774","9780393061314"]},"Edition":"Revised ed.","Feature":"Over 1 Million Copies Sold","Format":"Unabridged","IsAutographed":"0","ISBN":"0393317552","IsMemorabilia":"0","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"960","Length":"650","Weight":"210","Width":"160"},"Label":"W.

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In <i>The Sixth Extinction</i>, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and <i>New Yorker</i> writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Ecology","id":"13529"},{"name":"Environmental Science","id":"13598"},{"name":"Evolution","id":"13824"},{"name":"Natural History","id":"16311131"},{"name":"Endangered Species","id":"290064"},{"name":"Technology","id":"14631"},{"name":"Social Sciences","id":"11232"},{"name":"Biology & Life Sciences","id":"491702"},{"name":"Environmental Studies","id":"684290011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Elizabeth Kolbert","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Henry Holt Company","EAN":"9780805092998","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780805092998"},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"Henry Holt Company","ISBN":"0805092994","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"949","Length":"646","Weight":"125","Width":"117"},"Label":"Henry Holt and Co.","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3200","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$32.00"},"Manufacturer":"Henry Holt and Co.","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"336","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"120","Length":"930","Weight":"125","Width":"630"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2014-02-11","Publisher":"Henry Holt and Co.","ReleaseDate":"2014-02-11","Studio":"Henry Holt and Co.","Title":"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History"}}}},{"id":"0525427570","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2217,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$22.17"},"asin":"0525427570","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0525427570","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0525427570","salesRank":773,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51baoEVDKJL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51baoEVDKJL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress","similar":["0143122010","0393334775","1250107814","0078038367","1987690370","1980942277","161039741X","163286830X","0078119146","0142003344"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0525427570&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A56Z&v=2&sig=hbhqPdny0XdJt%252Fpq7VOMsoyiIdoBArNDF4FpR9%252BTVQY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p> <strong>INSTANT <em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER</strong> </p> <p> <strong>\"My new favorite book of all time.\" --Bill Gates</strong> </p> <p> <strong>If you think the world is coming to an end, think again: people are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives, and while our problems are formidable, the solutions lie in the Enlightenment ideal of using reason and science.</strong> </p> <p> Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing. </p> <p> Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature--tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking--which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation. </p> <p> With intellectual depth and literary flair, <em>Enlightenment Now</em> makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.] </p>"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2018:</strong> Given the 24-hour news cycle to which we have grown accustomed, it’s difficult to navigate life and think that everything is peachy. But Steven Pinker has set out, first in <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em>, and now in <em>Enlightenment Now</em>, to illustrate that there has never been a better time to be a human being. In his new book, Pinker points out that the slow creep of progress is not as newsworthy as, say, an earthquake or an explosion. So it’s clear why we don’t always have the sense that things are getting better. But the Enlightenment—with its dedication to science, reason, humanism, and progress—has led people to live longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives. And Pinker uses charts, data, history, and a firm dedication to his cause to empirically prove that we are living in better times. It makes sense to be skeptical of a scientist arguing that that science is the answer. And his optimism won’t always jibe with your personal experience or judgement. But there’s lots to chew on here—and it’s so easy to obsess on the intrusions and negatives of technology and “advancement” that this book can serve as a kind of antidote. <em>—Chris Schluep, the Amazon Book Review</em></p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Social Psychology & Interactions","id":"11223"},{"name":"State & Local","id":"14278871"},{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","id":"226685"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Violence in Society","id":"3825161"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Steven Pinker","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780525427575","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780525427575"},"Edition":"1st Edition","ISBN":"0525427570","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"956","Length":"644","Weight":"185","Width":"175"},"Label":"Viking","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$35.00"},"Manufacturer":"Viking","MPN":"27568198","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"576","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"180","Length":"960","Weight":"240","Width":"670"},"PartNumber":"27568198","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-02-13","Publisher":"Viking","ReleaseDate":"2018-02-13","Studio":"Viking","Title":"Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"}}}},{"id":"0316392006","data":{"width":51.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2211,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$22.11"},"asin":"0316392006","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Story-Big-History-Everything/dp/0316392006?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316392006","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Story-Big-History-Everything/dp/0316392006?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316392006","salesRank":5936,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51on7sjTv9L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"103"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51on7sjTv9L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"322"},"title":"Origin Story: A Big History of Everything","similar":["1250107814","1501139150","0399592067","0812985400","1465454438","147363749X","0812995341","1501139169","0525427570","0525512179"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0316392006&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A56Z&v=2&sig=kacw0hmOlnkyQssC1%252FHBBmodQjo0W%252BCoqwm5VPeOMe4%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>\"I have long been a fan of David Christian.

Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style-thorough, yet riveting-famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century-from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Subjects","id":"1000"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Yuval Noah Harari","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Homo Deus","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"9781784703936"},"EAN":"9781784703936","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781784703936"},"IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1784703931","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"118","Length":"1142","Weight":"99","Width":"787"},"Languages":{"Language":{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}},"MPN":"9781784703936","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"177","Length":"787","Weight":"132","Width":"492"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9781784703936","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"HOME","Title":"HOMO DEUS"}}}},{"id":"132854639X","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2800,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$28.00"},"asin":"132854639X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/132854639X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=132854639X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/132854639X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=132854639X","salesRank":32542,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H3qBIQdhL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H3qBIQdhL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order","similar":["0525512179","1732265100","1732265135","1633695670","1324002646","1501175513","1524760064","0670024937","0525536469","1982048808"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=132854639X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A57Z&v=2&sig=YwtwyKTSdOnK%252FWBO7PFBnuxZ8OcCjog9ro5CfXb1KBI%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<DIV><B>Dr. Kai-Fu Lee—one of the world’s most respected experts on AI and China —reveals that China has suddenly caught up to the US at an astonishingly rapid and unexpected pace.  </B><BR /><BR /> In AI SUPERPOWERS, Kai-fu Lee argues powerfully that because of these unprecedented developments in AI, dramatic changes will be happening much sooner than many of us expected.

Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and are afraid to speak honestly. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising—on campus as well as nationally. How did this happen?<br><br> First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: <i>What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker</i>; <i>always trust your feelings</i>; and <i>life is a battle between good people and evil people</i>. These three Great Untruths contradict basic psychological principles about well-being and ancient wisdom from many cultures.  Embracing these untruths—and the resulting culture of safetyism—interferes with young people’s social, emotional, and intellectual development. It makes it harder for them to become autonomous adults who are able to navigate the bumpy road of life.<br><br> Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to promote the spread of these untruths. They explore changes in childhood such as the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised, child-directed play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. They examine changes on campus, including the corporatization of universities and the emergence of new ideas about identity and justice. They situate the conflicts on campus within the context of America’s rapidly rising political polarization and dysfunction.<br><br> This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Social Psychology & Interactions","id":"11223"},{"name":"Popular Culture","id":"4556"},{"name":"Higher & Continuing Education","id":"69820"},{"name":"Education Theory","id":"69829"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Greg Lukianoff","Jonathan Haidt"],"Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780735224896","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780735224896"},"ISBN":"0735224897","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"955","Length":"641","Width":"114"},"Label":"Penguin Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Penguin Press","NumberOfPages":"352","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"114","Length":"955","Weight":"130","Width":"641"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-09-04","Publisher":"Penguin Press","ReleaseDate":"2018-09-04","Studio":"Penguin Press","Title":"The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure"}}}},{"id":"0670033375","data":{"width":50.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2284,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$22.84"},"asin":"0670033375","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Choose-Fail-Succeed/dp/0670033375?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0670033375","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Choose-Fail-Succeed/dp/0670033375?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0670033375","salesRank":32904,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CQYND2HHL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"101"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CQYND2HHL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"317"},"title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed","similar":["0393061310","0670024813","0060845503","0060183071","B019L4TPKQ","0393354326","0805092994","0307265722","140004006X","0143124404"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0670033375&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A57Z&v=2&sig=qVcVNhwPi0d8d64lFRotyoneIIR6ouVqwZSQgBZbK8M%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"A study of the downfall of some of history's greatest civilizations, written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Guns, Germs, and Steel, includes coverage of such cultures as the Anasazi, the Maya, and the Viking colony on Greenland, tracing patterns of environmental damage, climate change, poor political choices, and other factors that were pivotal to their demise. 250,000 first printing."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"Jared Diamond's <I>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed</I> is the glass-half-empty follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning <I>Guns, Germs, and Steel</I>. While <I>Guns, Germs, and Steel</I> explained the geographic and environmental reasons why some human populations have flourished, <I>Collapse</I> uses the same factors to examine why ancient societies, including the Anasazi of the American Southwest and the Viking colonies of Greenland, as well as modern ones such as Rwanda, have fallen apart. Not every collapse has an environmental origin, but an eco-meltdown is often the main catalyst, he argues, particularly when combined with society's response to (or disregard for) the coming disaster. Still, right from the outset of <I>Collapse</I>, the author makes clear that this is not a mere environmentalist's diatribe. He begins by setting the book's main question in the small communities of present-day Montana as they face a decline in living standards and a depletion of natural resources. Once-vital mines now leak toxins into the soil, while prion diseases infect some deer and elk and older hydroelectric dams have become decrepit. On all these issues, and particularly with the hot-button topic of logging and wildfires, Diamond writes with equanimity. <p> Because he's addressing such significant issues within a vast span of time, Diamond can occasionally speak too briefly and assume too much, and at times his shorthand remarks may cause careful readers to raise an eyebrow. But in general, Diamond provides fine and well-reasoned historical examples, making the case that many times, economic and environmental concerns are one and the same. With <I>Collapse</I>, Diamond hopes to jog our collective memory to keep us from falling for false analogies or forgetting prior experiences, and thereby save us from potential devastations to come. While it might seem a stretch to use medieval Greenland and the Maya to convince a skeptic about the seriousness of global warming, it's exactly this type of cross-referencing that makes <I>Collapse</I> so compelling. <I>--Jennifer Buckendorff</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Historical Study & Educational Resources","id":"4987"},{"name":"Civilization & Culture","id":"15812171"},{"name":"Environmental Science","id":"13598"},{"name":"Historic","id":"16244611"},{"name":"Human Geography","id":"11272"},{"name":"Cultural","id":"11235"},{"name":"General","id":"11237"},{"name":"Archaeology","id":"11242"},{"name":"Environmental Policy","id":"5571280011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jared Diamond","Binding":"Hardcover","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["XM-0670033375","POXM-0670033375"]},"EAN":"9780670033379","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780670033379"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"how societies choose to fail or succeeed","ISBN":"0670033375","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"958","Length":"646","Weight":"235","Width":"184"},"Label":"Penguin Group USA Inc.","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.95"},"Manufacturer":"Penguin Group USA Inc.","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"592","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"190","Length":"940","Weight":"235","Width":"630"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2004-12-31","Publisher":"Penguin Group USA Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2004-12-29","Studio":"Penguin Group USA Inc.","Title":"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed"}}}},{"id":"0393318885","data":{"width":51,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1203,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$12.03"},"asin":"0393318885","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Poverty-Nations-Some-Rich/dp/0393318885?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0393318885","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Poverty-Nations-Some-Rich/dp/0393318885?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0393318885","salesRank":41382,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Asry1yxuL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"102"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Asry1yxuL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"319"},"title":"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor","similar":["0140278796","140006256X","0471392642","0393354326","0385483821","0609809997","0061561614","0060845503","0312611692","019069985X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0393318885&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A57Z&v=2&sig=y6Va3sHWOfD3hNlRWbvJzITvbact4FdKIjKvhylCLzU%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><strong>\"Readers cannot but be provoked and stimulated by this splendidly iconoclastic and refreshing book.\"―Andrew Porter, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p><em>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</em> is David S.

Isolated from each other, the two halves of the world developed radically different suites of plants and animals. When Christopher Columbus set foot in the Americas, he ended that separation at a stroke. Driven by the economic goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new homes across the oceans. <br><br>The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is the reason there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland, and chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures the colonists knew nothing about hitched along for the ride. Earthworms, mosquitoes, and cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions, and African grasses; bacteria, fungi, and viruses; rats of every description—all of them rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like before, changing lives and landscapes across the planet. <br><br>Eight decades after Columbus, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country in the world. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, silver from the Americas, mined by African and Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the first time that goods and people from every corner of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi and the Spanish empire he served created a new world economically.<br><br>As Charles C. Mann shows, the Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent human history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico City—where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interacted—the center of the world. In such encounters, he uncovers the germ of today’s fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.<br><br>In <i>1493,</i> Charles Mann gives us an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<span class=\"h3color\"><strong>Guest Reviewer: Nathaniel Philbrick on <em>1493</em> by Charles C.

He has lived on Nantucket since 1986.</em> <p>I’m a big fan of Charles Mann’s previous book <em>1491</em>, in which he provides a sweeping and provocative examination of North and South America prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus. It’s exhaustively researched but so wonderfully written that it’s anything but exhausting to read.</p> <p>With his follow-up, <em>1493</em>, Mann has taken it to a new, truly global level. Building on the groundbreaking work of Alfred Crosby (author of <em>The Columbian Exchange</em> and, I’m proud to say, a fellow Nantucketer), Mann has written nothing less than the story of our world: how a planet of what were once several autonomous continents is quickly becoming a single, “globalized” entity.</p> <p>Mann not only talked to countless scientists and researchers; he visited the places he writes about, and as a consequence, the book has a marvelously wide-ranging yet personal feel as we follow Mann from one far-flung corner of the world to the next. And always, the prose is masterful. In telling the improbable story of how Spanish and Chinese cultures collided in the Philippines in the sixteenth century, he takes us to the island of Mindoro whose “southern coast consists of a number of small bays, one next to another like tooth marks in an apple.”</p> <p>We learn how the spread of malaria, the potato, tobacco, guano, rubber plants, and sugar cane have disrupted and convulsed the planet and will continue to do so until we are finally living on one integrated or at least close-to-integrated Earth. Whether or not the human instigators of all this remarkable change will survive the process they helped to initiate more than five hundred years ago remains, Mann suggests in this monumental and revelatory book, an open question.</p> <hr noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" class=\"bucketDivider\"/> <span class=\"h1\"><strong>A Letter from Charles C. Mann</strong></span> <p><img align=\"right\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/rando-ems/1493-Kid-eating-SP-250.jpg\"/></p> <p>It looked an ice cream cone. But when I came closer, I realized that the boy was eating a raw sweet potato. His father had whittled at the top to expose the orange flesh, which the boy was licking; the unpeeled bottom of the sweet potato served as a handle.</p> <p>This was at a farm about 300 miles northwest of Shanghai. Sweet potatoes are often eaten raw in rural China--a curiosity to Westerners like me. I didn’t realize that I had been staring until the boy ran to seek the protection of his father, who was hoeing a row of sweet potatoes. The father glared at me as I waved an apology. Because I don’t speak Chinese, I couldn’t tell him that I had been staring not at his son, but at the sweet potato in his hand. Nor could I say that I was staring because the sweet potato was an emblem of four hundred years of convulsive global change.</p> <p>Sweet potatoes are native to Central America. Spanish ships carried them to Manila in the 1570s, and then a Chinese ship captain smuggled the vines past Spanish customs by wrapping them around ropes and coiling the ropes in a basket. He took the contraband plants to Fujian, in southeast China, across from Taiwan. It was a time of famine in China. The captain’s son took the sweet potatoes to the governor of Fujian, who in turn ordered farmers to plant the fanshu (foreign tubers). The famine ended. Other regions took up sweet potatoes to solve their food problems. Millions of lives were saved. For three centuries the food of the Chinese poor was not rice but sweet potato.</p> <p>How did that Chinese kid get his sweet potato? Christopher Columbus. Scientists view Columbus as the man who inadvertently began an explosive global biological swap. After he established contact between the eastern and western hemisphere, thousands of plant and animal species ricocheted around the continents. It was the biggest event in the history of life since the death of the dinosaurs. The Columbian Exchange, as historians call it, is why there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in the United States, potatoes in Ireland, chili peppers in Thailand--and sweet potatoes in China.</p> <p>It also is a big part of the reason why the British lost the Revolutionary War, why Mexico City became the world’s first truly international city, and why millions of African slaves were transported unwillingly across the Atlantic. Indeed, these are among the subjects of my book, which is largely about the Columbian Exchange.</p> <p>The sweet potato--along with another American import, corn--did help save China from the calamity of famine. But they also caused another calamity. Traditional Chinese agriculture focused on rice, which had to be grown in wet river valleys. Sweet potatoes and corn could be grown in China’s dry highlands. Armies of farmers went out and cleared the forests on these highlands. The result was catastrophic erosion. Silt filled the Yangzi and Huang He (Yellow) rivers, setting off huge floods that killed millions of people. It was like one Katrina after another, a Chinese scientist told me. Beset by disaster, China fell behind in the race for global supremacy.</p> <p>All of this history was encapsulated in the boy and his sweet potato, though he didn’t know it. To him, it was just a snack. When I took out my camera, the boy’s father rolled his eyes in disbelief. But I was taking a picture of centuries of global turbulence. The boy pouted; I clicked the shutter.</p> <hr noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" class=\"bucketDivider\"/> <SPAN class=h3color><b>Timeline for <i>1493</i></b></SPAN> <br/> <b>200,000,000 B.C.:</b> Geological forces begin to break up the world’s single giant continent, Pangaea, forever separating the hemispheres. After this, Eurasia and the Americas develop completely different suites of plants and animals. <p/> <b>1493 A.D.:</b> Columbus sails on second voyage, establishing the first consequential European settlement in the Americas. Without intending to, he ends the long separation of the hemispheres—and sets off the ecological convulsion known as the Columbian Exchange. <p/> <b>1518:</b> In the first environmental calamity of the modern era, accidentally imported African scale insects in Hispaniola lead to an explosion of fire ants. Spaniards flee the ant-infested island in droves; colonists in Santo Domingo hold procession in honor of St. Saturninus, praying for his aid against the insect plague. <p/> <b>1545:</b> Spaniards discover the world’s biggest silver strike in Bolivia. In the next century, the world’s supply of this precious metal will more than double, giving Europe an economic edge that will help it colonize Africa, Asia and the Americas. <p/> <b>1549:</b> Initial appearance of tobacco—the addictive American drug that becomes the first global commodity craze—in China. That same year, Hernán Cortés inaugurates the human part of the Columbian Exchange by signing the first contract to import large numbers of Africans to the American mainland. <p/> <b>1571:</b> Miguel López de Legazpi colonizes Manila and establishes continual trade with China—Columbus’s life-long, never-fulfilled dream. Knitting the entire inhabited planet into a single web of trade, Legazpi’s actions are the beginning of today’s economic globalization. <p/> <b>~1615:</b> Earthworms come to northern North America in English ship ballast. During the next three centuries, they will re-engineer forests from Ohio Valley to Hudson Bay. <p/> <b>1630-60:</b> The gush of American silver finally causes its price to collapse, setting off a the world’s first global economic calamity. <p/> <b>1644:</b> Collapse of Ming dynasty. Long struggle between remaining Ming in south and incoming Qing dynasty in north leads the latter to forcibly evacuate most of the southern coast; millions of dispossessed people pour into the mountains, where they grow maize and sweet potatoes, American crops first smuggled into China from Manila and other European bases. <p/> <b>1775:</b> France’s Flour War, set off by high bread prices, persuades King Louis XVI to allow the pioneering nutritional chemist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier to stage a series of publicity stunts to persuade farmers to grow potatoes, a distrusted foreign species from Peru. Parmentier’s PR is so successful that broad swathes of northern Europe are soon covered with a monoculture of potatoes. <p/> <b>1781:</b> Britain’s “southern strategy” pushes Gen. Cornwallis’s army into North America’s malaria zone, an area dominated by malaria parasites introduced from Europe and Africa. Defeated by malaria, the British army surrenders to a general it never fought: George Washington. This ends the Revolutionary War. <p/> <b>1845:</b> Europe’s potato monoculture, which is unlike anything ever seen in Peru, turns out to be especially vulnerable to another Peruvian import, the potato blight. Ravaging the continent from Russia to Ireland, the blight causes a famine that kills an estimated two million people, half of them in Ireland. <p/> <b>~1867:</b> Léopold Trouvelot, French amateur entomologist, smuggles gypsy moths to Medford, Mass., hoping to breed them with native silk-producing moths to produce a more robust silk-producer. Their almost immediate escape sets off an invasion that continues today. Trouvelot hurriedly returns to France before the dimensions of the problem can be known. <p/> <b>1880-1912:</b> Industrializing nations, desperate for the elastic belts, pliable gaskets and the aborbent tires needed by steam engines and vehicles, buy every scrap of rubber they can get from the Amazon’s rubber trees, the sole source of high-quality latex. The ensuing rubber boom collapses after an Englishman smuggles rubber trees out of Brazil. Soon much of southeast Asia is covered with this foreign tree. <p/> <b>1979:</b> The golden apple snail is sent from Brazil to Taiwan to launch an escargot industry there. It escapes, proliferates, and becomes a major menace to the island’s rice crop. <p/> <hr noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" class=\"bucketDivider\"/>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economic History","id":"2589"},{"name":"Environmental Economics","id":"1043856"},{"name":"Native American","id":"4837"},{"name":"South America","id":"4840"},{"name":"Colonial Period","id":"4869"},{"name":"Expeditions & Discoveries","id":"3825131"},{"name":"Slavery & Emancipation","id":"16244141"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Human Geography","id":"11272"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Charles C.

The names belonged to two economists, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. Much of their work focused on a single question: Why are poor places poor, and is there something we can do about it?</p> <p>This is one of the most important questions imaginable in economics—indeed, in the world today. It is also one of the most politically fraught. In working on my book, I read numerous attempts by economists, historians and other researchers to explain why most of North America and Europe is wealthy and why most of Asia, Africa and Latin America is not. But these usually boiled down to claims that rich nations had won the game by cheating poor places or that poor places had inherently inferior cultures (or locations) which prevented them from rising. Conservative economists used the discussion as a chance to extol the wide-open markets they already believed in; liberal economists used it to make the attacks on unrestrained capitalism they were already making. And all too often both seemed wildly ignorant of history. I can’t recall encountering another subject on which so many people expended so much energy to generate so little light.</p> <p>Acemoglu and Robinson were in another category entirely. They assembled what is, in effect, a gigantic, super-complete database of every country’s history, and used it to ask questions—wicked smart questions. They found unexpected answers—ones that may not satisfy partisans of either side, but have the ring of truth.</p> <p><em>Why Nations Fail</em> is full of astounding stories. I ended up carrying the book around, asking friends, “Did you know this?” The stories make it a pleasure to read. More important, though, Acemoglu and Robinson changed my perspective on how the world works. My suspicion is that I won’t be the only person to say this after reading <em>Why Nations Fail</em>.</p> <p></p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Development & Growth","id":"2585"},{"name":"Economic Conditions","id":"2587"},{"name":"Economic History","id":"2589"},{"name":"Economic Policy & Development","id":"2588"},{"name":"Environmental Economics","id":"1043856"},{"name":"Theory","id":"2602"},{"name":"Income Inequality","id":"9147391011"},{"name":"International","id":"2657"},{"name":"Non-US Legal Systems","id":"10955"},{"name":"Comparative Politics","id":"5571274011"},{"name":"Political Economy","id":"5571263011"},{"name":"Economic Policy","id":"5571278011"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Daron Acemoglu","James A.

The history books most Americans were (and still are) raised on describe the continents before Columbus as a vast, underused territory, sparsely populated by primitives whose cultures would inevitably bow before the advanced technologies of the Europeans. For decades, though, among the archaeologists, anthropologists, paleolinguists, and others whose discoveries Charles C. Mann brings together in <I>1491</I>, different stories have been emerging. Among the revelations: the first Americans may not have come over the Bering land bridge around 12,000 B.C. but by boat along the Pacific coast 10 or even 20 thousand years earlier; the Americas were a far more urban, more populated, and more technologically advanced region than generally assumed; and the Indians, rather than living in static harmony with nature, radically engineered the landscape across the continents, to the point that even \"timeless\" natural features like the Amazon rainforest can be seen as products of human intervention. <p> Mann is well aware that much of the history he relates is necessarily speculative, the product of pot-shard interpretation and precise scientific measurements that often end up being radically revised in later decades. But the most compelling of his eye-opening revisionist stories are among the best-founded: the stories of early American-European contact. To many of those who were there, the earliest encounters felt more like a meeting of equals than one of natural domination. And those who came later and found an emptied landscape that seemed ripe for the taking, Mann argues convincingly, encountered not the natural and unchanging state of the native American, but the evidence of a sudden calamity: the ravages of what was likely the greatest epidemic in human history, the smallpox and other diseases introduced inadvertently by Europeans to a population without immunity, which swept through the Americas faster than the explorers who brought it, and left behind for their discovery a land that held only a shadow of the thriving cultures that it had sustained for centuries before. <I>--Tom Nissley</I><p> <p align=\"center\"> <span class=\"h1\"><strong>A <I>1491</I> Timeline</strong></span></p> <table cellpadding=\"4\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"4\"> <tr valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"> <td width=\"20%\"><strong>Europe and Asia</strong></td><p> <td width=\"10%\"><strong>Dates</strong></td> <td width=\"70%\"><strong>The Americas</strong></td> </tr><p> <tr valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"> <td width=\"20%\"></td><p> <td width=\"10%\">25000-35000 B.C.</td> <td width=\"70%\">Time of paleo-Indian migration to Americas from Siberia, according to genetic evidence.

Thaler has spent his career studying the radical notion that the central agents in the economy are humans―predictable, error-prone individuals. <em>Misbehaving</em> is his arresting, frequently hilarious account of the struggle to bring an academic discipline back down to earth―and change the way we think about economics, ourselves, and our world.</p><p>Traditional economics assumes rational actors. Early in his research, Thaler realized these Spock-like automatons were nothing like real people. Whether buying a clock radio, selling basketball tickets, or applying for a mortgage, we all succumb to biases and make decisions that deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economists. In other words, we misbehave. More importantly, our misbehavior has serious consequences. Dismissed at first by economists as an amusing sideshow, the study of human miscalculations and their effects on markets now drives efforts to make better decisions in our lives, our businesses, and our governments.</p><p>Coupling recent discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of incentives and market behavior, Thaler enlightens readers about how to make smarter decisions in an increasingly mystifying world. He reveals how behavioral economic analysis opens up new ways to look at everything from household finance to assigning faculty offices in a new building, to TV game shows, the NFL draft, and businesses like Uber.</p><p>Laced with antic stories of Thaler’s spirited battles with the bastions of traditional economic thinking, <em>Misbehaving</em> is a singular look into profound human foibles.

Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"-filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<I>Blink</I> is about the first two seconds of looking--the decisive glance that knows in an instant. Gladwell, the best-selling author of <I>The Tipping Point</I>, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of \"thin slices\" of behavior. The key is to rely on our \"adaptive unconscious\"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea. <p> Gladwell includes caveats about leaping to conclusions: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us \"mind blind,\" focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to \"the Warren Harding Effect\" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president).

Our mistakes make us poorer and less healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the family, and even the planet itself.<BR /><BR /> In <I>Nudge</I>, Thaler and Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes our humanness as a given.

Challenging our cherished belief of the \"self-made man,\" he makes the democratic assertion that superstars don't arise out of nowhere, propelled by genius and talent: \"they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot.\" Examining the lives of outliers from Mozart to Bill Gates, he builds a convincing case for how successful people rise on a tide of advantages, \"some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky.\"<br /><br /> <em>Outliers</em> can be enjoyed for its bits of trivia, like why most pro hockey players were born in January, how many hours of practice it takes to master a skill, why the descendents of Jewish immigrant garment workers became the most powerful lawyers in New York, how a pilots' culture impacts their crash record, how a centuries-old culture of rice farming helps Asian kids master math. But there's more to it than that. Throughout all of these examples--and in more that delve into the social benefits of lighter skin color, and the reasons for school achievement gaps--Gladwell invites conversations about the complex ways privilege manifests in our culture. He leaves us pondering the gifts of our own history, and how the world could benefit if more of our kids were granted the opportunities to fulfill their remarkable potential. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em><br/><br/>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Motivation & Self-Improvement","id":"2545"},{"name":"Economics","id":"2581"},{"name":"Motivational","id":"2685"},{"name":"Personal Finance","id":"2717"},{"name":"Social Psychology & Interactions","id":"11223"},{"name":"Statistics","id":"52161011"},{"name":"General","id":"6511988011"},{"name":"Social Sciences","id":"11232"},{"name":"Cultural","id":"11235"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Malcolm Gladwell","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Little, Brown and Company","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["XM-0316017922","POXM-0316017922"]},"EAN":"9780316017923","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780316017923","0791083538640"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Little Brown and Company","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0316017922","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"825","Length":"563","Weight":"60","Width":"100"},"Label":"Little, Brown and Company","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2900","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.00"},"Manufacturer":"Little, Brown and Company","MPN":"9780316017923","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"309","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"110","Length":"810","Weight":"95","Width":"540"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780316017923","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2008-11-18","Publisher":"Little, Brown and Company","ReleaseDate":"2008-11-18","Studio":"Little, Brown and Company","Title":"Outliers: The Story of Success","UPC":"791083538640","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"791083538640"}}}}},{"id":"0062364804","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1511,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$15.11"},"asin":"0062364804","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ends-World-Apocalypses-Understand-Extinctions/dp/0062364804?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062364804","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ends-World-Apocalypses-Understand-Extinctions/dp/0062364804?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062364804","salesRank":38029,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YWj5RCkTL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YWj5RCkTL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"The Ends of the World: Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans, and Our Quest to Understand Earth's Past Mass Extinctions","similar":["0062490427","031626024X","0805092994","0231182600","3319596349","0525955186","0691167664","1615194045","0143123645","1604697628"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0062364804&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A58Z&v=2&sig=GEYGhTBQMbR6GAkkEQ%252BP8qhy9hR%252BmRTQ4vgR629dkM4%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><strong><em>New York Times </em>Editors' Choice 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>Forbes </em>Top 10 Best Environment, Climate, and Conservation Book of 2017</strong></p><p><strong>As new groundbreaking research suggests that climate change played a major role in the most extreme catastrophes in the planet's history, award-winning science journalist Peter Brannen takes us on a wild ride through the planet's five mass extinctions and, in the process, offers us a glimpse of our increasingly dangerous future</strong> </p><p>Our world has ended five times: it has been broiled, frozen, poison-gassed, smothered, and pelted by asteroids.

At first his wealth inspires respect, but as his circumstances are mysteriously reduced he becomes shunned by those around him, and soon his only remaining visitors are his two beautifully dressed daughters. Goriot's fate is intertwined with two other fellow boarders: the young social climber Eugene Rastignac, who sees a way to gain the acceptance and wealth he craves, and the enigmatic figure of Vautrin, who is hiding darker secrets than anyone. Weaving a compelling and panoramic story of love, money, self-sacrifice, corruption, greed and ambition, Old Man Goriot is Balzac's acknowledged masterpiece. A key novel in <i>his Comédie Humaine</i> series, it is a vividly realized portrait of bourgeois Parisian society in the years following the French Revolution.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life.<br><br> As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights:<br><br> <b>• For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. </b>You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations.<br> <b>• Ethical rules aren’t universal.</b> You’re part of a group larger than you, but it’s still smaller than humanity in general.<br> <b>• Minorities, not majorities, run the world. </b>The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others.<br> <b>• You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot.</b> “Educated philistines” have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets.<br> <b>• Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find).</b> A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines.<br> <b>• True religion is commitment, not just faith.</b> How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you’re willing to risk for it.<br><br>The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, “The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the game.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb–veteran trader, renowned risk expert, polymathic scholar, erudite raconteur, and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Black Swan</i>–has written a modern classic that turns on its head what we believe about luck and skill.<br><br> This book is about luck–or more precisely, about how we perceive and deal with luck in life and business. Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous forum in which luck is mistaken for skill–the world of trading–<i>Fooled by Randomness</i> provides captivating insight into one of the least understood factors in all our lives. Writing in an entertaining narrative style, the author tackles major intellectual issues related to the underestimation of the influence of happenstance on our lives.<br><br> The book is populated with an array of characters, some of whom have grasped, in their own way, the significance of chance: the baseball legend Yogi Berra; the philosopher of knowledge Karl Popper; the ancient world’s wisest man, Solon; the modern financier George Soros; and the Greek voyager Odysseus. We also meet the fictional Nero, who seems to understand the role of randomness in his professional life but falls victim to his own superstitious foolishness.<br><br> However, the most recognizable character of all remains unnamed–the lucky fool who happens to be in the right place at the right time–he embodies the “survival of the least fit.” Such individuals attract devoted followers who believe in their guru’s insights and methods. But no one can replicate what is obtained by chance.<br><br> Are we capable of distinguishing the fortunate charlatan from the genuine visionary? Must we always try to uncover nonexistent messages in random events? It may be impossible to guard ourselves against the vagaries of the goddess Fortuna, but after reading <i>Fooled by Randomness</i> we can be a little better prepared.<br><br> <b><u>PRAISE FOR <i>FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS</i></u></b>:<br><br> <b>Named by Fortune One of the Smartest Books of All Time<br><br> A Financial Times Best Business Book of the Year</b><br><br> “[<i>Fooled by Randomness</i>] is to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther’s ninety-five theses were to the Catholic Church.”<br> –Malcolm Gladwell, author of <i>Blink</i><br><br> “The book that rolled down Wall Street like a hand grenade.”<br> –Maggie Mahar, author of <i>Bull!

What Taleb has identified and calls “antifragile” is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.  <br><br> In <i>The Black Swan, </i>Taleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. In <i>Antifragile,</i> Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better. <br><br> Furthermore, the antifragile is immune to prediction errors and protected from adverse events. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is what we call “efficient” not efficient at all? Why do government responses and social policies protect the strong and hurt the weak? Why should you write your resignation letter before even starting on the job? How did the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> save lives? The book spans innovation by trial and error, life decisions, politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are loud and clear.<br><br> <i>Antifragile</i> is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.<br><br> Erudite, witty, and iconoclastic, Taleb’s message is revolutionary: The antifragile, and only the antifragile, will make it.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Antifragile</i></b><br><br>“Ambitious and thought-provoking . . . highly entertaining.”<b>—<i>The Economist</i></b><br><br> “A bold book explaining how and why we should embrace uncertainty, randomness, and error . . .

But, according to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, there's an entire class of other things that don't simply resist stress but actually grow, strengthen, or otherwise gain from unforeseen and otherwise unwelcome stimuli. Taleb sees degrees of antifragility everywhere, from fasting, mythology, and urban planning to economic, technological, cultural, and biological systems. The wealth of radical thinking in this book astounds; the glossary alone offered more thought-provoking ideas than any other nonfiction book I read this year. That said, <i>Antifragile</i> is far from flawless. As comical as Taleb's rough handling of his favorite targets can be--academics, economists, and tourists, to name a few--his argumentative style boasts gaping holes, non sequiturs aplenty, and at times an almost willfully repugnant tone. Some readers will find Taleb's brashness off-putting; others will embrace it as a charismatic component of the ideas themselves. Either way, no one will finish this book unchanged. --<i>Jason Kirk</i>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Stocks","id":"2674"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"Personality","id":"11194"},{"name":"General","id":"6511988011"},{"name":"Phenomenology","id":"11063"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Taleb Nassim Nicholas","EAN":"9780812979688","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780812979688","8601400999004"]},"Edition":"Reprint","Feature":"Antifragile Things That Gain from Disorder","ISBN":"0812979680","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"796","Length":"514","Weight":"75","Width":"112"},"Label":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$18.00"},"Manufacturer":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","MPN":"21751399","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"544","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"780","Weight":"75","Width":"510"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"21751399","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2014-01-28","Publisher":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","ReleaseDate":"2014-01-28","Studio":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","Title":"Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder (Incerto)"}}}},{"id":"078583351X","data":{"width":44,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":711,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$7.11"},"asin":"078583351X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Man-Thinketh-Classic-Thoughts-Thinkers/dp/078583351X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=078583351X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Man-Thinketh-Classic-Thoughts-Thinkers/dp/078583351X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=078583351X","salesRank":38541,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CJS4QV2IL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"88"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CJS4QV2IL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"276"},"title":"As a Man Thinketh (Classic Thoughts and Thinkers)","similar":["0785833528","0807060100","1515436993","1939438551","1937879488","1846042844","1439167346","1945717424","1609420136","0062390627"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=078583351X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A18%3A59Z&v=2&sig=EkMHvcHI%252BEoqUzR1uZ2Ni4bL35z%252BIjUvCwEDP8EA9Ag%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<DIV><P><I>As a Man Thinketh</I> is James Allen's third book, first published in 1903. In it, he details how man is the creator and shaper of his destiny by the thoughts which he thinks. He rises and falls in exact accordance with the character of the thoughts which he entertains. His environment is the result of what he has thought and done in the past, and his circumstances in the future are being shaped and built by his present desires, aspirations, thoughts and actions. He therefore who chooses and pursues a particular line of thought, consciously builds his own destiny.<BR /><BR /> Part of the New Thought Movement, Allen reveals the secrets to having the most fulfilling existence possible, and it’s easier than any of us could have imagined.

At thirty-five, everything in her life seems to point toward “blessing.” She is thriving in her job, married to her high school sweetheart, and loves life with her newborn son.<br><br> Then she is diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer.<br><br>The prospect of her own mortality forces Kate to realize that she has been tacitly subscribing to the prosperity gospel, living with the conviction that she can control the shape of her life with “a surge of determination.” Even as this type of Christianity celebrates the American can-do spirit, it implies that if you “can’t do” and succumb to illness or misfortune, you are a failure. Kate is very sick, and no amount of positive thinking will shrink her tumors. What does it mean to die, she wonders, in a society that insists everything happens for a reason? Kate is stripped of this certainty only to discover that without it, life is hard but beautiful in a way it never has been before.<br><br> Frank and funny, dark and wise, Kate Bowler pulls the reader deeply into her life in an account she populates affectionately with a colorful, often hilarious retinue of friends, mega-church preachers, relatives, and doctors. <i>Everything Happens for a Reason</i> tells her story, offering up her irreverent, hard-won observations on dying and the ways it has taught her to live.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Everything Happens for a Reason</i></b><br>  <br> “I fell hard and fast for Kate Bowler.

In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. “My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy’s body.<br><br>From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul.<br><i><br>Lincoln in the Bardo</i> is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us.

If you can fight past an initial uncertainty about the identity of its narrators, you may find that it’s the best thing you’ve read in years. This first novel by acclaimed short-story-writer and essayist George Saunders (<em>Tenth of December</em>, <em>The Brain-Dead Megaphone</em>) will upend your expectations of what a novel should be. Saunders has said that “Lincoln in the Bardo” began as a play, and that sense of a drama gradually revealing itself through disparate voices remains in the work’s final form. </p> <p>The year is 1862. President Lincoln, already tormented by the knowledge that he’s responsible for the deaths of thousands of young men on the battlefields of the Civil War, loses his beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, to typhoid. The plot begins after Willie is laid to rest in a cemetery near the White House, where, invisible to the living, ghosts linger, unwilling to relinquish this world for the next. Their bantering conversation, much of it concerned with earthly -- and earthy – pleasures, counterbalances Lincoln’s abject sorrow. </p> Saunders takes huge risks in this novel, and they pay off. His writing is virtuosic – and best of all, its highs and lows are profoundly entertaining. You may hear echoes of Thornton Wilder, Beckett and even a little Chaucer, but <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em> is peculiar and perfect unto itself. Some advice: don’t try to read this one in a library. You’ll be hooting with laughter when you aren’t wiping away your tears. <em>--Sarah Harrison Smith, The Amazon Book Review</em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Biographical","id":"9332127011"},{"name":"Ghosts","id":"9810"},{"name":"United States","id":"9822"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"}],"attributes":{"Author":"George Saunders","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Random House","EAN":"9780812995343","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780812995343"},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"Random House","Format":"Deckle Edge","ISBN":"0812995341","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"952","Length":"661","Weight":"120","Width":"126"},"Label":"Random House","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Random House","MPN":"9780812995343","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"368","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"160","Length":"890","Weight":"120","Width":"640"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780812995343","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-02-14","Publisher":"Random House","ReleaseDate":"2017-02-14","Studio":"Random House","Title":"Lincoln in the Bardo: A Novel"}}}},{"id":"0399583602","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1704,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.04"},"asin":"0399583602","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solution-Why-Your-Broken/dp/0399583602?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0399583602","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solution-Why-Your-Broken/dp/0399583602?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0399583602","salesRank":98934,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HpFsD56wL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HpFsD56wL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep is Broken and How to Fix It","similar":["1623367395","0300224087","1501144316","1936303728","1626253439","110190402X","1101904003","1592337244","0805089586","1572246278"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0399583602&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A01Z&v=2&sig=x4C0dzj74wIX7bPfFC%252FjuR8r7SdF7Lidkv%252FS65Z4CCQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>With cutting-edge sleep science and time-tested techniques, <i>The Sleep Solution</i> will help anyone achieve healthy sleep and eliminate pills, pain, and fatigue.</b><br> <b> </b><br> If you want to fix your sleep problems, Internet tips and tricks aren’t going to do it for you.

We’re literally dying for a good night’s sleep.<BR> <BR> Our lifestyle wasn’t always this way. It began with the invention of the lightbulb.<BR> <BR> When we don’t get enough sleep in sync with seasonal light exposure, we fundamentally alter a balance of nature that has been programmed into our physiology since day one.

When we rely on artificial light to extend our day until 11 p.m., midnight, and beyond, we fool our bodies into living in a perpetual state of summer.

Astrophysicist Adam Frank traces the question of alien life and intelligence from the ancient Greeks to the leading thinkers of our own time, and shows how we as a civilization can only hope to survive climate change if we recognize what science has recently discovered: that we are just one of ten billion trillion planets in the Universe, and it’s highly likely that many of those planets hosted technologically advanced alien civilizations. What’s more, each of those civilizations must have faced the same challenge of civilization-driven climate change.</p><p>Written with great clarity and conviction, <em>Light of the Stars</em> builds on the inspiring work of pioneering scientists such as Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, whose work at the dawn of the space age began building the new science of astrobiology; Jack James, the Texas-born engineer who drove NASA’s first planetary missions to success; Vladimir Vernadsky, the Russian geochemist who first envisioned the Earth’s biosphere; and James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, who invented Gaia theory. Frank recounts the perilous journey NASA undertook across millions of miles of deep space to get its probes to Venus and Mars, yielding our first view of the cosmic laws of planets and climate that changed our understanding of our place in the universe.</p><p>Thrilling science at the grandest of scales, <em>Light of the Stars</em> explores what may be the largest question of all: What can the likely presence of life on other worlds tell us about our own fate?</p> 20 illustrations"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Astronomy","id":"13443"},{"name":"Astrophysics & Space Science","id":"13445"},{"name":"Astronomy & Astrophysics","id":"491700"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Adam Frank","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780393609011","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780393609011"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"0393609014","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"950","Length":"650","Weight":"108","Width":"110"},"Label":"W.

The two early impulses behind the urge to advance in science, he claims, are the conviction that apocalypse is imminent, and the belief that increasing human knowledge helps recover what was lost in Eden. Noble traces the history of these ideas by examining the imaginings of monks, explorers, magi, scientists, Freemasons, and engineers, from <b>Sir Isaac Newton</b> to <b>Joseph Priestley</b> to <b>Wernher von Braun</b>.<p>Noble suggests that the relationship between religion and technology has perhaps outlived its usefulness.

Yet for nearly all of its six million years of existence, human society had none of these things. While the gulf that divides us from our primitive ancestors may seem unbridgeably wide, we can glimpse much of our former lifestyle in those largely traditional societies still or recently in existence. Societies like those of the New Guinea Highlanders remind us that it was only yesterday—in evolutionary time—when everything changed and that we moderns still possess bodies and social practices often better adapted to traditional than to modern conditions.<i>The World Until Yesterday</i> provides a mesmerizing firsthand picture of the human past as it had been for millions of years—a past that has mostly vanished—and considers what the differences between that past and our present mean for our lives today.<br><br>This is Jared Diamond’s most personal book to date, as he draws extensively from his decades of field work in the Pacific islands, as well as evidence from Inuit, Amazonian Indians, Kalahari San people, and others. Diamond doesn’t romanticize traditional societies—after all, we are shocked by some of their practices—but he finds that their solutions to universal human problems such as child rearing, elder care, dispute resolution, risk, and physical fitness have much to teach us.

The archaeological record contains hundreds of situations in which societies developed long-term sustainable relationships with their environments—and thousands in which the relationships were destructive. Charles Redman demonstrates that much can be learned from an improved understanding of peoples who, through seemingly rational decisions, degraded their environments and threatened their own survival. By discussing archaeological case studies from around the world—from the deforestation of the Mayan lowlands to soil erosion in ancient Greece to the almost total depletion of resources on Easter Island—Redman reveals the long-range coevolution of culture and environment and clearly shows the impact that ancient peoples had on their world. These case studies focus on four themes: habitat transformation and animal extinctions, agricultural practices, urban growth, and the forces that accompany complex society. They show that humankind's commitment to agriculture has had cultural consequences that have conditioned our perception of the environment and reveal that societies before European contact did not necessarily live the utopian existences that have been popularly supposed. Whereas most books on this topic tend to treat human societies as mere reactors to environmental stimuli, Redman's volume shows them to be active participants in complex and evolving ecological relationships. <I>Human Impact on Ancient Environments</I> demonstrates how archaeological research can provide unique insights into the nature of human stewardship of the Earth and can permanently alter the way we think about humans and the environment.</DIV>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Ecology","id":"13529"},{"name":"Environmental Science","id":"13598"},{"name":"Human Geography","id":"11272"},{"name":"Archaeology","id":"11242"},{"name":"Environmental Studies","id":"684290011"},{"name":"Geography","id":"491454"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Charles L.

Description","content":"If you follow the news, the 21st century doesn't seem to be going so well. From 9/11 to the Great Recession, the Syrian civil war, the Ebola epidemic, growing inequality, racial unrest and bitterly contested elections, the world seems to be sinking into chaos and hatred. Moralizing commentators tell us that the decline of religious belief and close-knit communities has left us spiritually adrift, without a grounding in moral values, so it's no wonder we're suffering through an epidemic of loneliness, unhappiness and suicide. and then there are the futurologists who speculate on what will finish us off first: resource wars, nuclear annihilation, unstoppable climate change or robots that steal our jobs, enslave us and turn us into raw materials. But, as Steven Pinker argues in this landmark new book, we do not truly inhabit a dystopia of deprivation and violence: In fact, every global measure of human flourishing is on the rise. We're living longer, healthier, safer and more affluent lives-not just in the West, but worldwide. Why? In Enlightenment Now, Pinker proposes that human progress is the gift of a coherent value system that many of us embrace without even knowing it. The values of the Enlightenment underlie all our modern institutions and deserve credit for the stupendous progress we have made. The progress we have enjoyed is not, of course, an excuse for complacency: Some of the challenges we face today are unprecedented in their complexity and scope. The way to deal with these challenges, Pinker argues, is to treat them as problems to solve, as we have solved other problems in our past. Putting the case for an Enlightenment newly recharged for the 21st century, Pinker shows how, by using our faculties of reason and sympathy to understand the world and to enhance human flourishing, we can tackle problems that inevitably come with being products of evolution in an entropic universe."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Subjects","id":"1000"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Steven Pinker","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780241337011","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780241337011"},"Feature":"Enlightenment Now","ISBN":"0241337011","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"921","Length":"602","Weight":"141","Width":"126"},"Label":"Allen Lane","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"French","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"Allen Lane","MPN":"27200182","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"173","Length":"913","Weight":"141","Width":"606"},"PartNumber":"27200182","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-02-12","Publisher":"Allen Lane","Studio":"Allen Lane","Title":"Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"}}}},{"id":"0231182252","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2000,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$20.00"},"asin":"0231182252","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Cinematic-Overtures-Opening-Hastings-Lectures/dp/0231182252?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0231182252","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Cinematic-Overtures-Opening-Hastings-Lectures/dp/0231182252?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0231182252","salesRank":33762,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GcIEY6uRL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GcIEY6uRL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Cinematic Overtures: How to Read Opening Scenes (Leonard Hastings Schoff Lectures)","similar":["1501175513","0262037688","0810129485","1250107814","0451497899","022648775X","0399589813","1101980974","0735216134","1717229840"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0231182252&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A03Z&v=2&sig=fJAqr7fxTTlIJ7WTt3NMv2QhdisqhfAqXTMFcDeXRuQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"A great movie’s first few minutes provide the key to the rest of the film. Like the opening paragraphs of a novel, they draw the viewer in, setting up the thematic concerns and stylistic approach that will be developed over the course of the narrative. A strong opening sequence leads the viewer to trust the filmmakers. Other times, opening shots are intentionally misleading as they invite alert, active participation with the film. In <i>Cinematic Overtures,</i> Annette Insdorf discusses the opening sequence so that viewers turn first impressions into deeper understanding of cinematic technique.<br><br>From Joe Gillis’s voice-over in <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> as he lies dead in a swimming pool to the hallucinatory opening of <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, from the stream-of-consciousness montage as found in <i>Hiroshima, mon amour </i>to the slowly unfolding beginning of <i>Schindler’s List</i>, <i>Cinematic Overtures</i> analyzes opening shots from a range of Hollywood as well as international films. Insdorf pays close attention to how the viewer makes sense of these scenes and the cinematic world they are about to enter. Including dozens of frame enlargements that illustrate the strategies of opening scenes, Insdorf also examines how films explore and sometimes critique the power of the camera’s gaze. Along with analyses of opening scenes, the book offers a series of revelatory and surprising readings of individual films by some of the leading directors of the past seventy-five years. Erudite but accessible, <i>Cinematic Overtures</i> will lead film scholars and ardent movie fans alike to greater attentiveness to those fleeting opening moments."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Performing Arts","id":"521000"},{"name":"History & Criticism","id":"4495"},{"name":"Genre Films","id":"194810011"},{"name":"Theory","id":"194811011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Annette Insdorf","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780231182256","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780231182256"},"ISBN":"0231182252","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"550","Width":"50"},"Label":"Columbia University Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$20.00"},"Manufacturer":"Columbia University Press","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"208","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"79","Length":"831","Weight":"55","Width":"539"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-11-07","Publisher":"Columbia University Press","Studio":"Columbia University Press","Title":"Cinematic Overtures: How to Read Opening Scenes (Leonard Hastings Schoff Lectures)"}}}},{"id":"0262037688","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1740,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.40"},"asin":"0262037688","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Taming-Sun-Innovations-Harness-Energy/dp/0262037688?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0262037688","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Taming-Sun-Innovations-Harness-Energy/dp/0262037688?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0262037688","salesRank":29651,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PGt6t4e5L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PGt6t4e5L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Taming the Sun: Innovations to Harness Solar Energy and Power the Planet (The MIT Press)","similar":["0262035774","1501107933","1906860327","0262534940","1501105353","1786071339","1907670688","1632865688","1911299786","039335055X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0262037688&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A04Z&v=2&sig=wG1h7a9ggWnJmFkIELOa%252F7AtwJywnVexCKU8LJwMpCE%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<P><B>How solar could spark a clean-energy transition through transformative innovation―creative financing, revolutionary technologies, and flexible energy systems.</B></P><P>Solar energy, once a niche application for a limited market, has become the cheapest and fastest-growing power source on earth.

Written in the fourteenth century, the <em>Book</em> is a captivating blend of fact and fantasy, an extraordinary travel narrative that offers some revealing and unexpected attitudes towards other races and religions. It was immensely popular, and numbered among its readers Chaucer, Columbus, and Thomas More. Here Mandeville tells us about the Sultan in Cairo, the Great Khan in China, and the mythical Christian prince Prester John. There are giants and pygmies, cannibals and Amazons, headless humans and people with a single foot so huge it can shield them from the sun. Forceful and opinionated, the narrator is by turns learned, playful, and moralizing, with an endless curiosity about different cultures.<br><br>Anthony Bale provides a lively new translation along with an introduction that considers questions of authorship and origins, the early travel narrative, Crusading and religious difference, fantasy and the European Age of Discovery, and Mandeville's pervasive popularity and influence.

Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are? <br><br>Simply, no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise, how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world, while other African nations, such as Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are mired in poverty and violence? <br><br>Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea, to take just one of their fascinating examples, is a remarkably homogeneous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives, rewarded innovation, and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. <br><br>The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the people of the north have endured decades of famine, political repression, and very different economic institutions—with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories. <br><br>Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England, Europe, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, including: <br><br>- China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West? <br><br>- Are America’s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority? <br><br>- What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson’s breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions? <br><br><b><i>Why Nations Fail </i>will change the way you look at—and understand—the world. </b>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Development & Growth","id":"2585"},{"name":"Economic Conditions","id":"2587"},{"name":"Economic History","id":"2589"},{"name":"Economic Policy & Development","id":"2588"},{"name":"Environmental Economics","id":"1043856"},{"name":"Theory","id":"2602"},{"name":"Income Inequality","id":"9147391011"},{"name":"International","id":"2657"},{"name":"Non-US Legal Systems","id":"10955"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Comparative Politics","id":"5571274011"},{"name":"Political Economy","id":"5571263011"},{"name":"Economic Policy","id":"5571278011"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Daron Acemoglu","James A.

A behavior occurs--whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. What went on in a person's brain a second before the behavior happened? Then Sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli that triggered the nervous system? By now he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened.<br><br>Sapolsky keeps going: How was that behavior influenced by structural changes in the nervous system over the preceding months, by that person's adolescence, childhood, fetal life, and then back to his or her genetic makeup? Finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than one individual. How did culture shape that individual's group, what ecological factors millennia old formed that culture? And on and on, back to evolutionary factors millions of years old. <br><br>The result is one of the most dazzling tours d'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do...for good and for ill. Sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. Wise, humane, often very funny, <i>Behave</i> is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","id":"226685"},{"name":"Biology","id":"226688"},{"name":"Evolution","id":"13824"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Criminology","id":"11005"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Robert M.

Engaging directly with the reader in a manner that buttresses the personal intimacy of the story, De Vries writes with a powerful blend of grief, love, wit, and fury. <BR></DIV>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Contemporary","id":"10129"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Peter De Vries","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"De Vries, Peter/ Frank, Jeffrey (FRW)","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"AL12130393"},"EAN":"9780226143880","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780226143880"},"Edition":"New edition","ISBN":"0226143880","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"800","Length":"525","Weight":"60","Width":"70"},"Label":"University of Chicago Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1400","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$14.00"},"Manufacturer":"University of Chicago Press","MPN":"9780226143880","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"248","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"64","Length":"800","Weight":"79","Width":"525"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780226143880","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2005-06-01","Publisher":"University of Chicago Press","Studio":"University of Chicago Press","Title":"The Blood of the Lamb: A Novel"}}}},{"id":"8499926223","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":814,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$8.14"},"asin":"8499926223","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-animales-dioses-Sapiens-Humankind/dp/8499926223?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=8499926223","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-animales-dioses-Sapiens-Humankind/dp/8499926223?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=8499926223","salesRank":14639,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4124bI5HGlL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4124bI5HGlL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"Sapiens.

Some people feel passionately about the child obesity epidemic and support government regulation of sugary drinks. Others argue that people should be able to eat and drink whatever they like. Some people are alarmed about climate change and favor aggressive government intervention. Others don't feel the need for any sort of climate regulation. In <I>The Cost-Benefit Revolution</I>, Cass Sunstein argues our major disagreements really involve facts, not values. It follows that government policy should not be based on public opinion, intuitions, or pressure from interest groups, but on numbers―meaning careful consideration of costs and benefits. Will a policy save one life, or one thousand lives? Will it impose costs on consumers, and if so, will the costs be high or negligible? Will it hurt workers and small businesses, and, if so, precisely how much?</P><P>As the Obama administration's “regulatory czar,” Sunstein knows his subject in both theory and practice. Drawing on behavioral economics and his well-known emphasis on “nudging,” he celebrates the cost-benefit revolution in policy making, tracing its defining moments in the Reagan, Clinton, and Obama administrations (and pondering its uncertain future in the Trump administration). He acknowledges that public officials often lack information about costs and benefits, and outlines state-of-the-art techniques for acquiring that information. Policies should make people's lives better. Quantitative cost-benefit analysis, Sunstein argues, is the best available method for making this happen―even if, in the future, new measures of human well-being, also explored in this book, may be better still.</P>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economic Policy & Development","id":"2588"},{"name":"Education & Reference","id":"2732"},{"name":"Government & Business","id":"10020719011"},{"name":"Social Services & Welfare","id":"10580"},{"name":"Economic Policy","id":"5571278011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Cass R.

Sandel, author of <i>Justice</i></b></p><p>“Everyone worried about the state of contemporary politics should read this book.” ―<b>Anne-Marie Slaughter, President of the New America Foundation</b></p><p>The world is in turmoil. From Russia, Turkey, and Egypt to the United States, authoritarian populists have seized power. As a result, democracy itself may now be at risk.</p><p>Two core components of liberal democracy―individual rights and the popular will―are increasingly at war with each other. As the role of money in politics soared and important issues were taken out of public contestation, a system of “rights without democracy” took hold. Populists who rail against this say they want to return power to the people. But in practice they create something just as bad: a system of “democracy without rights.” The consequence, as Yascha Mounk shows in this brilliant and timely book, is that trust in politics is dwindling. Citizens are falling out of love with their political system. Democracy is wilting away. Drawing on vivid stories and original research, Mounk identifies three key drivers of voters’ discontent: stagnating living standards, fear of multiethnic democracy, and the rise of social media. To reverse the trend, politicians need to enact radical reforms that benefit the many, not the few.</p><p><i>The People vs. Democracy</i> is the first book to describe both how we got here and what we need to do now. For those unwilling to give up either individual rights or the concept of the popular will, Mounk argues that urgent action is needed, as this may be our last chance to save democracy.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"History","id":"9"},{"name":"Political","id":"11065"},{"name":"Democracy","id":"10761"},{"name":"History & Theory","id":"11086"},{"name":"Political Freedom","id":"3049211"},{"name":"Commentary & Opinion","id":"5571260011"},{"name":"Public Affairs & Policy","id":"5571275011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Yascha Mounk","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780674976825","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780674976825"},"ISBN":"0674976827","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"875","Length":"575","Weight":"135","Width":"125"},"Label":"Harvard University Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.95"},"Manufacturer":"Harvard University Press","MPN":"49087593","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"400","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"150","Length":"900","Weight":"135","Width":"600"},"PartNumber":"49087593","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-03-05","Publisher":"Harvard University Press","ReleaseDate":"2018-03-05","Studio":"Harvard University Press","Title":"The People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It"}}}},{"id":"0674975324","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1945,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$19.45"},"asin":"0674975324","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Third-Thoughts-Steven-Weinberg/dp/0674975324?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0674975324","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Third-Thoughts-Steven-Weinberg/dp/0674975324?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0674975324","salesRank":13082,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gh-ipoHwL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gh-ipoHwL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"Third Thoughts","similar":["1101986093","1476776628","0374146705","1541617592","0465094252","0465052614","0465096050","0062346660","073521610X","0525512179"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0674975324&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A05Z&v=2&sig=1fLG0jBeCQYQd1tmLt4PEpqLjtf8nnvlfvywH7vFpSk%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><b>A wise, personal, and wide-ranging meditation on science and society by the Nobel Prize–winning author of <i>To Explain the World</i>.</b></p><p>For more than four decades, one of the most captivating and celebrated science communicators of our time has challenged the public to think carefully about the foundations of nature and the inseparable entanglement of science and society.

He confronts one of the most difficult questions we face: How does our mind, our individual sense of self, emerge from the physical matter of the brain? The brain’s 86 billion neurons communicate with one another through very precise connections. But sometimes those connections are disrupted. The brain processes that give rise to our mind can become disordered, resulting in diseases such as autism, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder. While these disruptions bring great suffering, they can also reveal the mysteries of how the brain produces our most fundamental experiences and capabilities―the very nature of what it means to be human. Studies of autism illuminate the neurological foundations of our social instincts; research into depression offers important insights on emotions and the integrity of the self; and paradigm-shifting work on addiction has led to a new understanding of the relationship between pleasure and willpower.</p><p>By studying disruptions to typical brain functioning and exploring their potential treatments, we will deepen our understanding of thought, feeling, behavior, memory, and creativity.

The consequences of losing beavers were profound: streams eroded, wetlands dried up, and species from salmon to swans lost vital habitat. Today, a growing coalition of “Beaver Believers”―including scientists, ranchers, and passionate citizens―recognizes that ecosystems with beavers are far healthier, for humans and non-humans alike, than those without them. From the Nevada deserts to the Scottish highlands, Believers are now hard at work restoring these industrious rodents to their former haunts. <em>Eager</em> is a powerful story about one of the world’s most influential species, how North America was colonized, how our landscapes have changed over the centuries, and how beavers can help us fight drought, flooding, wildfire, extinction, and the ravages of climate change. Ultimately, it’s about how we can learn to coexist, harmoniously and even beneficially, with our fellow travelers on this planet.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Environmental","id":"13735"},{"name":"Mammals","id":"13499"},{"name":"Wildlife","id":"13509"},{"name":"Ecology","id":"13529"},{"name":"Lakes & Ponds","id":"14488"},{"name":"Natural History","id":"16311131"},{"name":"Natural Resources","id":"14507"},{"name":"Conservation","id":"290062"},{"name":"Environmentalism","id":"290441"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Ben Goldfarb","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781603587396","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781603587396"},"ISBN":"160358739X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"902","Length":"602","Width":"102"},"Label":"Chelsea Green Publishing","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2495","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$24.95"},"Manufacturer":"Chelsea Green Publishing","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"304","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"106","Length":"929","Weight":"133","Width":"634"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-07-05","Publisher":"Chelsea Green Publishing","ReleaseDate":"2018-06-27","Studio":"Chelsea Green Publishing","Title":"Eager: The Surprising, Secret Life of Beavers and Why They Matter"}}}},{"id":"0062803700","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2999,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$29.99"},"asin":"0062803700","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Apprentice-Russia-Subversion-American-Democracy/dp/0062803700?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062803700","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Apprentice-Russia-Subversion-American-Democracy/dp/0062803700?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062803700","salesRank":29622,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41otY5vyFKL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41otY5vyFKL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"The Apprentice: Trump, Russia and the Subversion of American Democracy","similar":["1501175513","152474350X","198210970X","1324002646","1982103124","125030119X","0544716248","0316484814","0062690779","1612197396"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0062803700&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A06Z&v=2&sig=YIubkFJsv7nNNS0GXFW1IDz6cMYFNTyZjU7gPwiAC90%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>It has been called the political crime of the century: a foreign government, led by a brutal authoritarian leader, secretly interfering with the American presidential election to help elect the candidate of its choice.

Reliant only on Enlightenment liberalism, the United States has become the home of the cowardly, the shameless, the selfish, and the alienated. Properly channeled, honor encourages virtues like courage, integrity, and solidarity, and gives a sense of living for something larger than oneself.

Learn why students hunt for easy As and casually forget most of what they learn after the final exam, why decades of growing access to education have not resulted in better jobs for the average worker but instead in runaway credential inflation, how employers reward workers for costly schooling they rarely if ever use, and why cutting education spending is the best remedy.</p><p>Caplan draws on the latest social science to show how the labor market values grades over knowledge, and why the more education your rivals have, the more you need to impress employers. He explains why graduation is our society's top conformity signal, and why even the most useless degrees can certify employability. He advocates two major policy responses. The first is educational austerity. Government needs to sharply cut education funding to curb this wasteful rat race. The second is more vocational education, because practical skills are more socially valuable than teaching students how to outshine their peers.</p><p>Romantic notions about education being \"good for the soul\" must yield to careful research and common sense―<i>The Case against Education</i> points the way.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economics","id":"2581"},{"name":"Public Affairs & Policy","id":"5571275011"},{"name":"Vocational","id":"16022311"},{"name":"Administration","id":"69830"},{"name":"Reform & Policy","id":"16022391"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Bryan Caplan","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780691174655","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780691174655"},"ISBN":"0691174652","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"975","Length":"650","Weight":"159","Width":"125"},"Label":"Princeton University Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.95"},"Manufacturer":"Princeton University Press","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"416","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"126","Length":"937","Weight":"159","Width":"630"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-01-30","Publisher":"Princeton University Press","Studio":"Princeton University Press","Title":"The Case against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money"}}}},{"id":"0670024813","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1229,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$12.29"},"asin":"0670024813","link":"https://www.amazon.com/World-Until-Yesterday-Traditional-Societies/dp/0670024813?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0670024813","url":"https://www.amazon.com/World-Until-Yesterday-Traditional-Societies/dp/0670024813?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0670024813","salesRank":340822,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51X1n8gAQ2L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51X1n8gAQ2L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies?","similar":["0670033375","0060845503","0393061310","0060183071","0465031277","140004006X","0307265722","0143117009","0393354326","007811702X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0670024813&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A07Z&v=2&sig=xb00dIKMLlBokgY9JRGp2%252FFncVPjN2olrTP9IRJclcI%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Most of us take for granted the features of our modern society, from air travel and telecommunications to literacy and obesity. Yet for nearly all of its six million years of existence, human society had none of these things. While the gulf that divides us from our primitive ancestors may seem unbridgeably wide, we can glimpse much of our former lifestyle in those largely traditional societies still or recently in existence. Societies like those of the New Guinea Highlanders remind us that it was only yesterday—in evolutionary time—when everything changed and that we moderns still possess bodies and social practices often better adapted to traditional than to modern conditions.<br><br><i>The World Until Yesterday</i> provides a mesmerizing firsthand picture of the human past as it had been for millions of years—a past that has mostly vanished—and considers what the differences between that past and our present mean for our lives today.<br>This is Jared Diamond’s most personal book to date, as he draws extensively from his decades of field work in the Pacific islands, as well as evidence from Inuit, Amazonian Indians, Kalahari San people, and others. Diamond doesn’t romanticize traditional societies—after all, we are shocked by some of their practices—but he finds that their solutions to universal human problems such as child rearing, elder care, dispute resolution, risk, and physical fitness have much to teach us. A characteristically provocative, enlightening, and entertaining book, <i>The World Until Yesterday</i> will be essential and delightful

Now astrophysicist John Gribbin draws on his expertise to explore, in prose that communicates not only the wonder but the substance of cutting-edge science, the principles behind chaos and complexity. He reveals the remarkable ways these two revolutionary theories have been applied over the last twenty years to explain all sorts of phenomena–from weather patterns to mass extinctions.<br><br>Grounding these paradigm-shifting ideas in their historical context, Gribbin also traces their development from Newton to Darwin to Lorenz, Prigogine, and Lovelock, demonstrating how–far from overturning all that has gone before–chaos and complexity are the triumphant extensions of simple scientific laws. Ultimately, Gribbin illustrates how chaos and complexity permeate the universe on every scale, governing the evolution of life and galaxies alike."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Evolution","id":"13824"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Chaos Theory","id":"13567"}],"attributes":{"Author":"John Gribbin","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Random House","EAN":"9781400062560","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781400062560"},"Edition":"Later Printing Used","Feature":"Random House","ISBN":"140006256X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"866","Length":"574","Weight":"85","Width":"103"},"Label":"Random House","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Random House","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"304","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"120","Length":"820","Weight":"85","Width":"560"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2005-04-05","Publisher":"Random House","ReleaseDate":"2005-04-05","Studio":"Random House","Title":"Deep Simplicity: Bringing Order to Chaos and Complexity"}}}},{"id":"0471392642","data":{"width":51,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1496,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.96"},"asin":"0471392642","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Warren-Buffett-Portfolio-Mastering-Investment/dp/0471392642?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0471392642","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Warren-Buffett-Portfolio-Mastering-Investment/dp/0471392642?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0471392642","salesRank":136872,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qp5u1D4xL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"102"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qp5u1D4xL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"320"},"title":"The Warren Buffett Portfolio: Mastering the Power of the Focus Investment Strategy","similar":["1118503252","140006256X","0393318885","0140278796","1578645018","0471445509","0385483821","0471446912","0609809997","1400077303"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0471392642&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A07Z&v=2&sig=PJC0KR48u%252FY7UkNbXOXRFjAec56Z0ADSjAAhsjvGa8g%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"The Warren Buffett Way provided the first look into the strategiesthat the master uses to pick stocks.

When a Strategic Inflection Point hits, the ordinary rules of business go out the window.

The emergence of factories, railroads, and gunboats propelled the West's rise to power in the nineteenth century, and the development of computers and nuclear weapons in the twentieth century secured its global supremacy. Now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, many worry that the emerging economic power of China and India spells the end of the West as a superpower. In order to understand this possibility, we need to look back in time. Why has the West dominated the globe for the past two hundred years, and will its power last?</p><p>Describing the patterns of human history, the archaeologist and historian Ian Morris offers surprising new answers to both questions. It is not, he reveals, differences of race or culture, or even the strivings of great individuals, that explain Western dominance. It is the effects of geography on the everyday efforts of ordinary people as they deal with crises of resources, disease, migration, and climate. As geography and human ingenuity continue to interact, the world will change in astonishing ways, transforming Western rule in the process.</p><p>Deeply researched and brilliantly argued, <i>Why the West Rules―for Now </i>spans fifty thousand years of history and offers fresh insights on nearly every page.

Rather they are crafted by individuals, firms, and most of all, by governments. Thus \"marketcraft\" represents a core function of government comparable to statecraft and requires considerable artistry to govern markets effectively. Just as real-world statecraft can be masterful or muddled, so it is with marketcraft. <br><br>In <em>Marketcraft,</em> Steven Vogel builds his argument upon the recognition that all markets are crafted then systematically explores the implications for analysis and policy. In modern societies, there is no such thing as a free market. Markets are institutions, and contemporary markets are all heavily regulated. The \"free market revolution\" that began in the 1980s did not see a deregulation of markets, but rather a re-regulation. Vogel looks at a wide range of policy issues to support this concept, focusing in particular on the US and Japan. He examines how the US, the \"freest\" market economy, is actually among the most heavily regulated advanced economies, while Japan's effort to liberalize its economy counterintuitively expanded the government's role in practice. <br><br><em>Marketcraft </em>demonstrates that market institutions need government to function, and in increasingly complex economies, governance itself must feature equally complex policy tools if it is to meet the task. In our era-and despite what anti-government ideologues contend-governmental officials, regardless of party affiliation, should be trained in marketcraft just as much as in statecraft.<br>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economic Conditions","id":"2587"},{"name":"Economic Policy & Development","id":"2588"},{"name":"Retailing","id":"2656"},{"name":"Canadian","id":"5571269011"},{"name":"Political Economy","id":"5571263011"},{"name":"Economic Policy","id":"5571278011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Steven K.

Can our world support that? What kind of world will it be? Those answering these questions generally fall into two deeply divided groups--Wizards and Prophets, as Charles Mann calls them in this balanced, authoritative, nonpolemical new book. The Prophets, he explains, follow William Vogt, a founding environmentalist who believed that in using more than our planet has to give, our prosperity will lead us to ruin. <i>Cut back</i>! was his mantra. <i>Otherwise everyone will lose</i>! The Wizards are the heirs of Norman Borlaug, whose research, in effect, wrangled the world in service to our species to produce modern high-yield crops that then saved millions from starvation. <i>Innovate</i>! was Borlaug's cry. <i>Only in that way can everyone win</i>! Mann delves into these diverging viewpoints to assess the four great challenges humanity faces--food, water, energy, climate change--grounding each in historical context and weighing the options for the future.

The book offers a fresh account of the activities of the best-known conquistadors and explorers, including Columbus, Cortés, and Pizarro. <br><br>Using a wide array of sources, historian Matthew Restall highlights seven key myths, uncovering the source of the inaccuracies and exploding the fallacies and misconceptions behind each myth. This vividly written and authoritative book shows, for instance, that native Americans did not take the conquistadors for gods and that small numbers of vastly outnumbered Spaniards did not bring down great empires with stunning rapidity. We discover that Columbus was correctly seen in his lifetime--and for decades after--as a briefly fortunate but unexceptional participant in efforts involving many southern Europeans. It was only much later that Columbus was portrayed as a great man who fought against the ignorance of his age to discover the new world. Another popular misconception--that the Conquistadors worked alone--is shattered by the revelation that vast numbers of black and native allies joined them in a conflict that pitted native Americans against each other. This and other factors, not the supposed superiority of the Spaniards, made conquests possible.<br><br>The Conquest, Restall shows, was more complex--and more fascinating--than conventional histories have portrayed it. <em>Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest</em> offers a richer and more nuanced account of a key event in the history of the Americas.<br>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Europe","id":"4935"},{"name":"Historiography","id":"4988"},{"name":"World","id":"5035"},{"name":"Latin America","id":"491418"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Matthew Restall","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780195176117","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780195176117","8588050206044"]},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"0195176111","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"610","Length":"910","Weight":"96","Width":"90"},"Label":"Oxford University Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1999","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$19.99"},"Manufacturer":"Oxford University Press","MPN":"11 halftones & 1 map","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"240","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"60","Length":"925","Weight":"96","Width":"600"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"11 halftones & 1 map","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2004-10-28","Publisher":"Oxford University Press","Studio":"Oxford University Press","Title":"Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest"}}}},{"id":"0394557824","data":{"width":55,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2750,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$27.50"},"asin":"0394557824","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Unredeemed-Captive-Family-Story-America/dp/0394557824?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0394557824","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Unredeemed-Captive-Family-Story-America/dp/0394557824?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0394557824","salesRank":292102,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YHYPQ9YBL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"110"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YHYPQ9YBL.jpg","Height":"475","Width":"328"},"title":"The Unredeemed Captive: A Family Story from Early America","similar":["0452288193","0312167075","0307265722","0195098315","039392291X","0195176111","0143122029","1557091188","0195088476","0307278247"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0394557824&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A08Z&v=2&sig=edD4ij8ZmO%252B2SZ8WNu4KOGCsK%252B1YK9Ujs4R14huNrCY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Nominated for the National Book Award, this book is set in colonial Massachusetts where, in 1704, a French and Indian war party descended on the village of Deerfield, abducting a Puritan minister and his children.

Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i>, Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.</p><p>Piketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II.

They have made America the most unequal advanced industrial country while crippling growth, trampling on the rule of law, and undermining democracy. The result: a divided society that cannot tackle its most pressing problems. With characteristic insight, Stiglitz examines our current state, then teases out its implications for democracy, for monetary and budgetary policy, and for globalization.

The book shines much-needed light on this group of small nations, largely unnoticed by the industrialized West, that are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world's people, often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nations between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure, pointing to a set of traps that ensnare these countries, including civil war, a dependence on the extraction and export of natural resources, and bad governance. Standard solutions do not work, he writes; aid is often ineffective, and globalization can actually make matters worse, driving development to more stable nations. What the bottom billion need, Collier argues, is a bold new plan supported by the Group of Eight industrialized nations. If failed states are ever to be helped, the G8 will have to adopt preferential trade policies, new laws against corruption, new international charters, and even conduct carefully calibrated military interventions. Collier has spent a lifetime working to end global poverty.

The ships, huge junks nearly five hundred feet long and built from the finest teak, were under the command of Emperor Zhu Di's loyal eunuch admirals. Their mission was \"to proceed all the way to the end of the earth to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond the seas\" and unite the whole world in Confucian harmony. Their journey would last more than two years and circle the globe. </p><p>When they returned in October 1423, the emperor had fallen, leaving China in political and economic chaos. The great ships, now considered frivolous, were left to rot at their moorings and the records of their journeys were destroyed. Lost in China's long, self-imposed isolation that followed was the knowledge that Chinese ships had reached America seventy years before Columbus and circumnavigated the globe a century before Magellan. Also concealed were how the Chinese colonized America before the Europeans and transplanted to America, Australia, New Zealand and South America the principal economic crops that have fed and clothed the world.</p><p>Now, in a landmark historical journey, Gavin Menzies, who spent fifteen years tracing the astonishing voyages of the Chinese fleet, shares the remarkable account of his discoveries and the incontrovertible evidence to support them. His compelling narrative pulls together ancient maps, precise navigational knowledge, astronomy and the surviving accounts of Chinese explorers and the later European navigators to prove that the Chinese had also discovered Antarctica, reached Australia three hundred and fifty years before Cook and solved the problem of longitude three hundred years ahead of the Europeans. 1421 describes the artifacts and inscribed stones left behind by the emperor's fleet, the evidence of wrecked junks along its route -- discovered in locations ranging from the middle of the Mississippi River to tributaries of the Amazon -- and the ornate votive offerings left by the Chinese sailors wherever they landed, in honor of Shao Lin, goddess of the sea.</p><p><em>1421: The Year China Discovered America</em> is the story of a remarkable journey of discovery that rewrites our understanding of history. Our knowledge of world exploration as it has been commonly accepted for centuries must now be reconceived due to this classic work of historical detection.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Americas","id":"4808"},{"name":"China","id":"4891"},{"name":"Naval","id":"5018"},{"name":"Expeditions & Discoveries","id":"3825131"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Gavin Menzies","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780060537630","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780060537630"},"Edition":"Later prt.","ISBN":"0060537639","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"613","Weight":"205","Width":"163"},"Label":"William Morrow","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2795","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.95"},"Manufacturer":"William Morrow","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"552","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"180","Length":"920","Weight":"205","Width":"640"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2003-01","Publisher":"William Morrow","ReleaseDate":"2003-01-07","Studio":"William Morrow","Title":"1421: The Year China Discovered America"}}}},{"id":"0062693018","data":{"width":55,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2179,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$21.79"},"asin":"0062693018","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0062693018?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062693018","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0062693018?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062693018","salesRank":33040,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51j4MJgHSZL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"110"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51j4MJgHSZL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"345"},"title":"A People's History of the United States","similar":["1595583262","1583228691","1786630818","0375714499","1595230017","1620974673","140004006X","0393061310","0060168366","1501175513"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0062693018&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A09Z&v=2&sig=pCmGo%252FLCHMIqmAZr4H7G%252BqJfeKzkk96X1eUBS8pvICQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><strong>With a new introduction by Anthony Arnove, this updated edition of the classic national bestseller reviews the book’s thirty-five year history and demonstrates once again why it is a significant contribution to a complete and balanced understanding of American history.</strong></p><p>Since its original landmark publication in 1980, <em>A People's History of the United States</em> has been chronicling American history from the bottom up, throwing out the official version of history taught in schools—with its emphasis on great men in high places—to focus on the street, the home, and the, workplace.</p><p>Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, <em>A People's History</em> <em>of the United States</em> is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of—and in the words of—America's women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers.

Yet how did all this emerge from what was once an insignificant village in central Italy? In <em>S.P.Q.R.</em>, world-renowned classicist Mary Beard narrates the unprecedented rise of a civilization that even two thousand years later still shapes many of our most fundamental assumptions about power, citizenship, responsibility, political violence, empire, luxury, and beauty.</p><p>From the foundational myth of Romulus and Remus to 212 ce―nearly a thousand years later―when the emperor Caracalla gave Roman citizenship to every free inhabitant of the empire, <em>S.P.Q.R.</em> (the abbreviation of \"The Senate and People of Rome\") examines not just how we think of ancient Rome but challenges the comfortable historical perspectives that have existed for centuries by exploring how the Romans thought of <em>themselves</em>: how they challenged the idea of imperial rule, how they responded to terrorism and revolution, and how they invented a new idea of citizenship and nation.</p><p>Opening the book in 63 bce with the famous clash between the populist aristocrat Catiline and Cicero, the renowned politician and orator, Beard animates this “terrorist conspiracy,” which was aimed at the very heart of the Republic, demonstrating how this singular event would presage the struggle between democracy and autocracy that would come to define much of Rome’s subsequent history. Illustrating how a classical democracy yielded to a self-confident and self-critical empire, <em>S.P.Q.R.</em> reintroduces us, though in a wholly different way, to famous and familiar characters―Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Augustus, and Nero, among others―while expanding the historical aperture to include those overlooked in traditional histories: the women, the slaves and ex-slaves, conspirators, and those on the losing side of Rome’s glorious conquests.</p><p>Like the best detectives, Beard sifts fact from fiction, myth and propaganda from historical record, refusing either simple admiration or blanket condemnation. Far from being frozen in marble, Roman history, she shows, is constantly being revised and rewritten as our knowledge expands. Indeed, our perceptions of ancient Rome have changed dramatically over the last fifty years, and <em>S.P.Q.R.</em>, with its nuanced attention to class inequality, democratic struggles, and the lives of entire groups of people omitted from the historical narrative for centuries, promises to shape our view of Roman history for decades to come.</p> 100 illustrations; 16 pages of color; 5 maps"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Rome","id":"4883"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Mary Beard","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Liveright Publishing Corporation","EAN":"9780871404237","EANList":{"EANListElement":["4708364214618","9780871404237"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Liveright Publishing Corporation","ISBN":"0871404230","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"960","Length":"650","Weight":"225","Width":"180"},"Label":"Liveright","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$35.00"},"Manufacturer":"Liveright","MPN":"100 illustrations; 16 pages of color; 5","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"608","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"190","Length":"960","Weight":"230","Width":"660"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"100 illustrations; 16 pages of color; 5","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2015-11-09","Publisher":"Liveright","ReleaseDate":"2015-11-09","Studio":"Liveright","Title":"SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome"}}}},{"id":"081299339X","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1112,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$11.12"},"asin":"081299339X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Faster-Better-Productive-Business/dp/081299339X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=081299339X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Faster-Better-Productive-Business/dp/081299339X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=081299339X","salesRank":23524,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517Y2sOZAYL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517Y2sOZAYL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business","similar":["1400069289","1594488843","1591847834","081298160X","1626561230","0316017922","0525429565","0805091742","1439167346","1591842808"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=081299339X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A09Z&v=2&sig=w%252FS%252FUER32h60X6pQB0wX8te9XXXsqcCndNg87tYb01Q%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER • <b>From the author of <i>The Power of Habit </i>comes a fascinating book that explores the science of productivity, and why managing <i>how</i> you think is more important than <i>what</i> you think—with an appendix of real-world lessons to apply to your life.</b></b><br><br> At the core of <i>Smarter Faster Better</i> are eight key productivity concepts—from motivation and goal setting to focus and decision making—that explain why some people and companies get so much done.

Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments in uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis’s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms.</p><p><em>The Undoing Project</em> is about a compelling collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the university and on the battlefield―both had important careers in the Israeli military―and their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self-confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room; Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They became one of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, working together so closely that they couldn’t remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. They flipped a coin to decide the lead authorship on the first paper they wrote, and simply alternated thereafter.</p><p>This story about the workings of the human mind is explored through the personalities of two fascinating individuals so fundamentally different from each other that they seem unlikely friends or colleagues. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind’s view of its own mind.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Scientists","id":"2426"},{"name":"Social Scientists & Psychologists","id":"2427"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"History","id":"11177"},{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","id":"573358"},{"name":"Cognitive","id":"15811861"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Michael Lewis","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"W W Norton Company","EAN":"9780393254594","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780393254594"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"W W Norton Company","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0393254593","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"930","Weight":"145","Width":"600"},"Label":"W.

Unfortunately, people tend to be terrible forecasters. As Wharton professor Philip Tetlock showed in a landmark 2005 study, even experts’ predictions are only slightly better than chance. However, an important and underreported conclusion of that study was that some experts do have real foresight, and Tetlock has spent the past decade trying to figure out why. What makes some people so good? And can this talent be taught?<br>  <br> In <i>Superforecasting</i>, Tetlock and coauthor Dan Gardner offer a masterwork on prediction, drawing on decades of research and the results of a massive, government-funded forecasting tournament. The Good Judgment Project involves tens of thousands of ordinary people—including a Brooklyn filmmaker, a retired pipe installer, and a former ballroom dancer—who set out to forecast global events. Some of the volunteers have turned out to be astonishingly good. They’ve beaten other benchmarks, competitors, and prediction markets. They’ve even beaten the collective judgment of intelligence analysts with access to classified information. They are \"superforecasters.\"<br>  <br> In this groundbreaking and accessible book, Tetlock and Gardner show us how we can learn from this elite group. Weaving together stories of forecasting successes (the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound) and failures (the Bay of Pigs) and interviews with a range of high-level decision makers, from David Petraeus to Robert Rubin, they show that good forecasting doesn’t require powerful computers or arcane methods. It involves gathering evidence from a variety of sources, thinking probabilistically, working in teams, keeping score, and being willing to admit error and change course. <br><br><i>Superforecasting</i> offers the first demonstrably effective way to improve our ability to predict the future—whether in business, finance, politics, international affairs, or daily life—and is destined to become a modern classic."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Planning & Forecasting","id":"2689"},{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","id":"573358"},{"name":"Technology","id":"14631"},{"name":"Cognitive","id":"15811861"},{"name":"Social Sciences","id":"11232"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Philip E.

He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of the website FiveThirtyEight.<br><br>Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.<br><br>In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good—or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary—and dangerous—science.<br><br>Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.<br><br>With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver’s insights are an essential read."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2012:</b> People love statistics. Statistics, however, do not always love them back. <i>The Signal and the Noise</i>, Nate Silver's brilliant and elegant tour of the modern science-slash-art of forecasting, shows what happens when Big Data meets human nature. Baseball, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, economics, and polling: In all of these areas, Silver finds predictions gone bad thanks to biases, vested interests, and overconfidence. But he also shows where sophisticated forecasters have gotten it right (and occasionally been ignored to boot).

Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In <em>Dollars and Sense</em>, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal finance’s most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices.</p><p>Exploring a wide range of everyday topics—from the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the  pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday sales—Ariely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether it’s the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.</p><p>The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, <em>Dollars and Sense</em> provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Finance","id":"2604"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Consumer Behavior","id":"2700"},{"name":"Budgeting & Money Management","id":"2719"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"Applied Psychology","id":"11130"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Dr. Dan Ariely","Jeff Kreisler"],"Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Unknown","EAN":"9780062651204","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780062651204"},"ISBN":"006265120X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"97"},"Label":"Harper","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2799","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.99"},"Manufacturer":"Harper","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"288","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"106","Length":"929","Weight":"106","Width":"638"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-11-07","Publisher":"Harper","ReleaseDate":"2017-11-07","Studio":"Harper","Title":"Dollars and Sense: How We Misthink Money and How to Spend Smarter"}}}},{"id":"0061995037","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2047,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$20.47"},"asin":"0061995037","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Irrationality-Unexpected-Benefits-Defying/dp/0061995037?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0061995037","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Irrationality-Unexpected-Benefits-Defying/dp/0061995037?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0061995037","salesRank":288719,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ucv9nGv7L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ucv9nGv7L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"335"},"title":"The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home","similar":["0061854549","1501120042","0062183591","0062183613","0061353248","0062379992","006265120X","014311526X","0393080943","0300122233"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0061995037&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A10Z&v=2&sig=elJTaULhs3Y4w%252FkC%252BuPZXv7QLbBGHQ3QuSg9VYtxbdY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>“Dan Ariely is a genius at understanding human behavior: no economist does a better job of uncovering and explaining the hidden reasons for the weird ways we act.” — James Surowiecki, author of <em>The Wisdom of Crowds </em></p><p>Behavioral economist and <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Predictably Irrational</em> Dan Ariely returns to offer a much-needed take on the irrational decisions that influence our dating lives, our workplace experiences, and our temptation to cheat in any and all areas.

or the phenomena of word of mouth or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life,\" writes Malcolm Gladwell, \"is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.\" Although anyone familiar with the theory of memetics will recognize this concept, Gladwell's <I>The Tipping Point</I> has quite a few interesting twists on the subject.<p> For example, Paul Revere was able to galvanize the forces of resistance so effectively in part because he was what Gladwell calls a \"Connector\": he knew just about everybody, particularly the revolutionary leaders in each of the towns that he rode through. But Revere \"wasn't just the man with the biggest Rolodex in colonial Boston,\" he was also a \"Maven\" who gathered extensive information about the British. He knew what was going on and he knew exactly whom to tell. The phenomenon continues to this day--think of how often you've received information in an e-mail message that had been forwarded at least half a dozen times before reaching you.<p> Gladwell develops these and other concepts (such as the \"stickiness\" of ideas or the effect of population size on information dispersal) through simple, clear explanations and entertainingly illustrative anecdotes, such as comparing the pedagogical methods of <I>Sesame Street</I> and <I>Blue's Clues</I>, or explaining why it would be even easier to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with the actor Rod Steiger. Although some readers may find the transitional passages between chapters hold their hands a little too tightly, and Gladwell's closing invocation of the possibilities of social engineering sketchy, even chilling, <I>The Tipping Point</I> is one of the most effective books on science for a general audience in ages. It seems inevitable that \"tipping point,\" like \"future shock\" or \"chaos theory,\" will soon become one of those ideas that everybody knows--or at least knows by name. <I>--Ron Hogan</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Strategy & Competition","id":"2553"},{"name":"Advertising","id":"2699"},{"name":"Consumer Behavior","id":"2700"},{"name":"Research","id":"2709"},{"name":"Social Psychology & Interactions","id":"11223"},{"name":"Essays","id":"10114"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Sociology","id":"11288"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Malcolm Gladwell","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Little Brown and Company","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["POXM-0316316962","XM-0316316962"]},"Color":"White","EAN":"9780316316965","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780316316965"},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"Little Brown and Company","Format":"Kindle eBook","ISBN":"0316316962","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"825","Length":"575","Weight":"79","Width":"100"},"Label":"Little, Brown","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Little, Brown","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"288","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"94","Length":"811","Weight":"79","Width":"543"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2000-02-29","Publisher":"Little, Brown","Studio":"Little, Brown","Title":"The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference"}}}},{"id":"0316204366","data":{"width":56,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":699,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$6.99"},"asin":"0316204366","link":"https://www.amazon.com/David-Goliath-Underdogs-Misfits-Battling/dp/0316204366?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316204366","url":"https://www.amazon.com/David-Goliath-Underdogs-Misfits-Battling/dp/0316204366?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316204366","salesRank":15853,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hjTdanuNL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"112"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hjTdanuNL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"349"},"title":"David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants","similar":["0316172324","0316075841","0316316962","0316017922","0316346624","0316076201","0316017930","0316010669","0374275637","1603093001"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0316204366&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A11Z&v=2&sig=ewbsyj717AWMsCxlk5F3K6pWud0193Pnhzx%252Fo0dkeXM%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<strong>Malcolm Gladwell, the #1 bestselling author of <i>The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers, </i>and <i>What the Dog Saw,</i> offers his most provocative---and dazzling---book yet.<br></strong><br>Three thousand years ago on a battlefield in ancient <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Palestine</st1:place></st1:city>, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants.

In <I>Once Upon an Algorithm</I>, Martin Erwig explains computation as something that takes place beyond electronic computers, and computer science as the study of systematic problem solving. Erwig points out that many daily activities involve problem solving. Getting up in the morning, for example: You get up, take a shower, get dressed, eat breakfast. This simple daily routine solves a recurring problem through a series of well-defined steps. In computer science, such a routine is called an algorithm.</P><P>Erwig illustrates a series of concepts in computing with examples from daily life and familiar stories. Hansel and Gretel, for example, execute an algorithm to get home from the forest. The movie <I>Groundhog Day </I>illustrates the problem of unsolvability; Sherlock Holmes manipulates data structures when solving a crime; the magic in Harry Potter's world is understood through types and abstraction; and Indiana Jones demonstrates the complexity of searching. Along the way, Erwig also discusses representations and different ways to organize data; “intractable” problems; language, syntax, and ambiguity; control structures, loops, and the halting problem; different forms of recursion; and rules for finding errors in algorithms.</P><P>This engaging book explains computation accessibly and shows its relevance to daily life.

Thaler has spent his career studying the radical notion that the central agents in the economy are humans―predictable, error-prone individuals. <em>Misbehaving</em> is his arresting, frequently hilarious account of the struggle to bring an academic discipline back down to earth―and change the way we think about economics, ourselves, and our world.</p><p>Traditional economics assumes rational actors. Early in his research, Thaler realized these Spock-like automatons were nothing like real people. Whether buying a clock radio, selling basketball tickets, or applying for a mortgage, we all succumb to biases and make decisions that deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economists. In other words, we misbehave. More importantly, our misbehavior has serious consequences. Dismissed at first by economists as an amusing sideshow, the study of human miscalculations and their effects on markets now drives efforts to make better decisions in our lives, our businesses, and our governments.</p><p>Coupling recent discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of incentives and market behavior, Thaler enlightens readers about how to make smarter decisions in an increasingly mystifying world. He reveals how behavioral economic analysis opens up new ways to look at everything from household finance to assigning faculty offices in a new building, to TV game shows, the NFL draft, and businesses like Uber.</p><p>Laced with antic stories of Thaler’s spirited battles with the bastions of traditional economic thinking, <em>Misbehaving</em> is a singular look into profound human foibles.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress—to measure what mattered.<br><br>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove (\"the greatest manager of his or any era\") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.<br><br>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization. <br><br>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention.<br><br>In <i>Measure What Matters</i>, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. This book will help a new generation of leaders capture the same magic."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Workplace Culture","id":"2571"},{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategy & Competition","id":"2553"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"John Doerr","Binding":"Hardcover","Creator":"Larry Page","EAN":"9780525536222","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780525536222"},"ISBN":"0525536221","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"580","Weight":"97","Width":"100"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","MPN":"43192-806097","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"320","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"830","Weight":"95","Width":"560"},"PartNumber":"43192-806097","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-04-24","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2018-04-24","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs"}}}},{"id":"0060555661","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1499,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.99"},"asin":"0060555661","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0060555661","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0060555661","salesRank":228,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513e7BP39PL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513e7BP39PL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"332"},"title":"The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing.

In this respect, <I>The Intelligent Investor</I> is a book for true investors, not speculators or day traders. He provides, \"in a form suitable for the laymen, guidance in adoption and execution of an investment policy\" (1). This policy is inherently for the longer term and requires a commitment of effort. Where the speculator follows market trends, the investor uses discipline, research, and his analytical ability to make unpopular but sound investments in bargains relative to current asset value. Graham coaches the investor to develop a rational plan for buying stocks and bonds, and he argues that this plan must be a bulwark against emotional behavior that will always be tempting during abrupt bull and bear markets. <p> Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's investment guide has sold over a million copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" These accolades are well deserved. In its new form--with commentary on each chapter and extensive footnotes prepared by senior <I>Money</I> editor, Jason Zweig--the classic is now updated in light of changes in investment vehicles and market activities since 1972. What remains is a better book. Graham's sage advice, analytical guides, and cautionary tales are still valid for the contemporary investor, and Zweig's commentaries demonstrate the relevance of Graham's principles in light of 1990s and early twenty-first century market trends. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economics","id":"2581"},{"name":"Finance","id":"2604"},{"name":"Introduction","id":"2670"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Benjamin Graham","Jason Zweig"],"Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"HarperBusiness","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["POXM-0060555661","FPS-318894","XM-0060555661","AL06601036"]},"Creator":"Warren E.

In twenty-five chapters―each about a particular rock, outcrop, or geologic phenomenon―Donald R. Prothero recounts the scientific detective work that shaped our understanding of geology, from the unearthing of exemplary specimens to tectonic shifts in how we view the inner workings of our planet. <br><br>Prothero follows in the footsteps of the scientists who asked―and answered―geology’s biggest questions: How do we know how old the earth is? What happened to the supercontinent Pangea? How did ocean rocks end up at the top of Mount Everest? What can we learn about our planet from meteorites and moon rocks? He answers these questions through expertly chosen case studies, such as Pliny the Younger’s firsthand account of the eruption of Vesuvius; the granite outcrops that led a Scottish scientist to theorize that the landscapes he witnessed were far older than Noah’s Flood; the salt and gypsum deposits under the Mediterranean Sea that indicate that it was once a desert; and how trying to date the age of meteorites revealed the dangers of lead poisoning. Each of these breakthroughs filled in a piece of the greater puzzle that is the earth, with scientific discoveries dovetailing with each other to offer an increasingly coherent image of the geologic past. Summarizing a wealth of information in an entertaining, approachable style, <i>The Story of the Earth in 25 Rocks</i> is essential reading for the armchair geologist, the rock hound, and all who are curious about the earth beneath their feet."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Historical","id":"16052841"},{"name":"Evolution","id":"13824"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Donald R.

We have been making enormous changes to subterranean America, and Mother Earth, as always, has been making some of her own. . . . The consequences for our real estate, our civil engineering, and our communities will be huge because they will include earthquakes most of us do not expect and cannot imagine—at least not without reading <i>Quakeland</i>. Kathryn Miles descends into mines in the Northwest, dissects Mississippi levee engineering studies, uncovers the horrific risks of an earthquake in the Northeast, and interviews the seismologists, structual engineers, and emergency managers around the country who are addressing this ground shaking threat. <br><br>As Miles relates, the era of human-induced earthquakes began in 1962 in Colorado after millions of gallons of chemical-weapon waste was pumped underground in the Rockies. More than 1,500 quakes over the following seven years resulted. The Department of Energy plans to dump spent nuclear rods in the same way. Evidence of fracking’s seismological impact continues to mount. . . . Humans as well as fault lines built our “quakeland”.<br><br> What will happen when Memphis, home of FedEx's 1.5-million-packages-a-day hub, goes offline as a result of an earthquake along the unstable Reelfoot Fault?

The acclaimed Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh argues that future generations may well think so. How else to explain our imaginative failure in the face of global warming? In his first major book of nonfiction since <I>In an Antique Land</I>, Ghosh examines our inability—at the level of literature, history, and politics—to grasp the scale and violence of climate change.<BR /><BR /> The extreme nature of today’s climate events, Ghosh asserts, make them peculiarly resistant to contemporary modes of thinking and imagining. This is particularly true of serious literary fiction: hundred-year storms and freakish tornadoes simply feel too improbable for the novel; they are automatically consigned to other genres. In the writing of history, too, the climate crisis has sometimes led to gross simplifications; Ghosh shows that the history of the carbon economy is a tangled global story with many contradictory and counterintuitive elements.<BR /><BR /> Ghosh ends by suggesting that politics, much like literature, has become a matter of personal moral reckoning rather than an arena of collective action. But to limit fiction and politics to individual moral adventure comes at a great cost. The climate crisis asks us to imagine other forms of human existence—a task to which fiction, Ghosh argues, is the best suited of all cultural forms. His book serves as a great writer’s summons to confront the most urgent task of our time.<BR />  </DIV>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Movements & Periods","id":"10225"},{"name":"Climatology","id":"16053231"},{"name":"Conservation","id":"290062"},{"name":"Environmentalism","id":"290441"},{"name":"Politics & Government","id":"5571255011"},{"name":"Literature","id":"468236"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","id":"491730"},{"name":"Political Science","id":"491464"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Amitav Ghosh","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780226526812","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780226526812"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"022652681X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"550","Width":"60"},"Label":"University of Chicago Press","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$15.00"},"Manufacturer":"University of Chicago Press","MPN":"47828631","NumberOfPages":"176","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"63","Length":"843","Weight":"35","Width":"543"},"PartNumber":"47828631","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-07-24","Publisher":"University of Chicago Press","ReleaseDate":"2016-09-14","Studio":"University of Chicago Press","Title":"The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable (Berlin Family Lectures)"}}}},{"id":"0143130447","data":{"width":62.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1495,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.95"},"asin":"0143130447","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Drawdown-Comprehensive-Proposed-Reverse-Warming/dp/0143130447?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143130447","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Drawdown-Comprehensive-Proposed-Reverse-Warming/dp/0143130447?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143130447","salesRank":3204,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uz0PSVkVL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"125"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uz0PSVkVL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"391"},"title":"Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming","similar":["1426203853","0061252794","1465433643","163286102X","1250142083","1101983825","1933820314","1501170252","014312868X","0865477485"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0143130447&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A13Z&v=2&sig=YB2M8KSlZBZOiMbtvVJYwK8hUOyxXxSGb1d8DG8nNcE%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><b><b><i><b><b><b><i><b><b><b><b><b>• </b></b></b></b></b></i></b></b></b>New York Times</i> bestseller <b><b><b><i><b><b><b><b><b>•</b></b></b></b></b></i></b></b></b></b></b><br><br>The 100 most substantive solutions to reverse global warming, based on meticulous research by leading scientists and policymakers around the world<br><br>“At this point in time, the <i>Drawdown</i> book is exactly what is needed; a credible, conservative solution-by-solution narrative that we can do it.

By the end of this century, hundreds of millions of people living at low elevations along coasts will be forced to retreat to higher and safer ground. Because of sea-level rise, major storms will inundate areas farther inland and will lay waste to critical infrastructure, such as water-treatment and energy facilities, creating vast, irreversible pollution by decimating landfills and toxic-waste sites. This big-picture, policy-oriented book explains in gripping terms what rising oceans will do to coastal cities and the drastic actions we must take now to remove vulnerable populations.<br><br>The authors detail specific threats faced by Miami, New Orleans, New York, and Amsterdam. Aware of the overwhelming social, political, and economic challenges that would accompany effective action, they consider the burden to the taxpayer and the logistics of moving landmarks and infrastructure, including toxic-waste sites.

On a map they can look like the veins, arteries, and capillaries of a continent-wide circulatory system, and in a way they are. Over the course of this nation’s history rivers have served as integral trade routes, borders, passageways, sewers, and sinks. Over the years, based on our shifting needs and values, we have harnessed their power with waterwheels and dams, straightened them for ships, drained them with irrigation canals, set them on fire, and even attempted to restore them.</p><p>In this fresh and powerful work of environmental history, Martin Doyle tells the epic story of America and its rivers, from the U.S. Constitution’s roots in interstate river navigation, the origins of the Army Corps of Engineers, the discovery of gold in 1848, and the construction of the Hoover Dam and the TVA during the New Deal, to the failure of the levees in Hurricane Katrina and the water wars in the west. Along the way, he explores how rivers have often been the source of arguments at the heart of the American experiment―over federalism, sovereignty and property rights, taxation, regulation, conservation, and development.</p><p>Through his encounters with experts all over the country―a Mississippi River tugboat captain, an Erie Canal lock operator, a dendrochronologist who can predict the future based on the story trees tell about the past, a western rancher fighting for water rights―Doyle reveals the central role rivers have played in American history―and how vital they are to its future.</p> 20 illustrations"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"United States","id":"4853"},{"name":"Water Quality & Treatment","id":"226549"},{"name":"Hydrology","id":"13665"},{"name":"Historic","id":"16244611"},{"name":"Rivers","id":"13625"},{"name":"Water Supply & Land Use","id":"14543"},{"name":"Conservation","id":"290062"},{"name":"Political Science","id":"16022621"},{"name":"Engineering","id":"468212"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","id":"491730"},{"name":"Government","id":"684293011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Martin Doyle","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780393242355","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780393242355"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"0393242358","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"960","Length":"650","Width":"120"},"Label":"W.

The project began with a grievance, the grievance of a daughter whose parent had absconded from her life. I was in pursuit of a scofflaw, an artful dodger who had skipped out on so many things―obligation, affection, culpability, contrition. I was preparing an indictment, amassing discovery for a trial. But somewhere along the line, the prosecutor became a witness.”</p><p> So begins Susan Faludi’s extraordinary inquiry into the meaning of identity in the modern world and in her own haunted family saga. When the feminist writer learned that her 76-year-old father―long estranged and living in Hungary―had undergone sex reassignment surgery, that investigation would turn personal and urgent. How was this new parent who identified as “a complete woman now” connected to the silent, explosive, and ultimately violent father she had known, the photographer who’d built his career on the alteration of images?</p><p> Faludi chases that mystery into the recesses of her suburban childhood and her father’s many previous incarnations: American dad, Alpine mountaineer, swashbuckling adventurer in the Amazon outback, Jewish fugitive in Holocaust Budapest. When the author travels to Hungary to reunite with her father, she drops into a labyrinth of dark histories and dangerous politics in a country hell-bent on repressing its past and constructing a fanciful―and virulent―nationhood. The search for identity that has transfixed our century was proving as treacherous for nations as for individuals. </p><p> Faludi’s struggle to come to grips with her father’s metamorphosis takes her across borders―historical, political, religious, sexual--to bring her face to face with the question of the age: Is identity something you “choose,” or is it the very thing you can’t escape?</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Journalists","id":"172763"},{"name":"Women","id":"2445"},{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","id":"2439"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Susan Faludi","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Metropolitan Books","EAN":"9780805089080","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780805089080"},"Edition":"1st Edition","Feature":"Metropolitan Books","ISBN":"080508908X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"962","Length":"640","Weight":"135","Width":"135"},"Label":"Metropolitan Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3200","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$32.00"},"Manufacturer":"Metropolitan Books","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"432","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"150","Length":"920","Weight":"135","Width":"640"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-06-14","Publisher":"Metropolitan Books","ReleaseDate":"2016-06-14","Studio":"Metropolitan Books","Title":"In the Darkroom"}}}},{"id":"0553447432","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1185,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$11.85"},"asin":"0553447432","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Evicted-Poverty-Profit-American-City/dp/0553447432?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0553447432","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Evicted-Poverty-Profit-American-City/dp/0553447432?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0553447432","salesRank":5709,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41goF2jdAyL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41goF2jdAyL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"335"},"title":"Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City","similar":["1631492853","0544303180","0374189978","0062300547","1501102230","1620972255","0812994523","031641560X","0262035774","1620971631"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0553447432&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A14Z&v=2&sig=4vML4kEkoyl%252FY%252FOA%252BkwaTcNvy%252FxD4JG34uKHofB37VI%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><i>WINNER OF THE 2017 PULITZER PRIZE FOR GENERAL NONFICTION <br><br></i></b>In <i>Evicted</i>, Princeton sociologist and MacArthur “Genius” Matthew Desmond follows eight families in Milwaukee as they struggle to keep a roof over their heads.

Matthew Desmond does just that with <em>Evicted</em> as he explores the stories of tenants and landlords in the poorest areas of Milwaukee during 2008 and 2009. It’s almost always a compliment to say that a nonfiction book reads like a novel and this one does – mostly because Desmond gets very close to the “characters,” relating their words and thoughts and layering on enough vibrant details to make every rented property or trailer come alive. You can almost forget that these are actual people with actual problems until he delivers a raw jolt of reality: the woman who’s evicted because her boyfriend beats her up; the tenant whose baby daughter dies in a house fire; the tenant who pushes a “friend” out a window for using all her cell phone minutes; the landlord who refuses to fix stopped-up pipes, so tenants allow garbage and sewage to pile up in the property. <p>Through both personal stories and data, Desmond proves that eviction undermines self, family, and community, bearing down disproportionately hard on women with children. In Milwaukee, being behind on rent gives landlords the opening to serve an eviction notice, which leads to a court date. On the face of it, it may seem easy to side with the landlords—of course tenants should pay their rent. But as <em>Evicted</em> pulls back layer after layer, what’s exposed is a cycle of hurt that all parties—landlord, tenant, city—inflict on one another. Whether readers agree with Desmond’s conclusions for how to break this cycle in order to strengthen families and neighborhoods, it’s obvious by the end of <em>Evicted</em> that there is no easy fix, and that people—some addicts, some criminals—will slip through the cracks. But it should be just as obvious that we must still try. </p><em>—Adrian Liang</em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Income Inequality","id":"9147391011"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","id":"226685"},{"name":"Poverty","id":"10576"},{"name":"Urban","id":"11296"},{"name":"Class","id":"271633011"},{"name":"Public Affairs & Policy","id":"5571275011"},{"name":"Public Policy","id":"491474"},{"name":"Sociology","id":"491478"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Matthew Desmond","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Crown Pub","EAN":"9780553447439","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780553447439"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Crown Pub","Format":"Deckle Edge","ISBN":"0553447432","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"953","Length":"656","Weight":"150","Width":"146"},"Label":"Crown","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Crown","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"432","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"142","Length":"961","Weight":"304","Width":"677"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-03-01","Publisher":"Crown","ReleaseDate":"2016-03-01","Studio":"Crown","Title":"Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City"}}}},{"id":"0143109278","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1084,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$10.84"},"asin":"0143109278","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Association-Small-Bombs-Novel/dp/0143109278?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143109278","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Association-Small-Bombs-Novel/dp/0143109278?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143109278","salesRank":34083,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CI6Qk5iKL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CI6Qk5iKL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"326"},"title":"The Association of Small Bombs: A Novel","similar":["0312641575","0425238369","1464146381","0312275420","0140152741","125011814X","0571224644","0716701073","1250050642","0133173658"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0143109278&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A14Z&v=2&sig=58mphAV0e0rtqCAu2RKnuhnSQkHxu3lH7RtIXzVu5yg%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>National Book Award <b><b><b><b><b><b>Finalist</b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b><br><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>Winner of the New York Public Library Young Lions Fiction Award</b></b></b></b></b></b></b><br><b><b><b><b><b>Winner of the American Academy of Arts & Letters Rosenthal Family Foundation Award<br></b>Winner of the Anisfield-Wolf Award<br></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>Winner of the Bard Fiction Prize<br>One of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i><b>’s Ten Best Books of the Year<br><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>One of <i>Granta</i>’s Best Young American Novelists</b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b><br>A <i>Washington Post</i> Notable Fiction Book of the Year<br>PEN Center USA Literary Award Finalist for Fiction<br>Simpson Family Literary Prize Finalist<br>Shortlisted for the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature <br><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>Longlisted for </b></b></b>the FT/Oppenheimer Emerging Voices Award</b></b></b></b><br></b></b><br>Named a Best Book of the Year by: <i>Buzzfeed, Esquire,</i> <b><i>New York</i> magazine, </b><i>The Huffington Post</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The AV Club</i>, <i>The Fader</i>, <i>Redbook</i>, <i>Electric Literature</i>, <i>Book Riot</i>, <i>Bustle</i>, <i>Good magazine</i>, <i>PureWow</i>, and <i>PopSugar<br><br></i></b></b>“Wonderful. . . .

Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood—where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned—Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.<br>      In Whitehead’s ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.<br>      Like the protagonist of <i>Gulliver’s Travels,</i> Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey—hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre–Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. <i>The Underground Railroad</i> is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman’s ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Historical","id":"10177"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Colson Whitehead","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Doubleday","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"611652"},"EAN":"9780385542364","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780385542364"},"Edition":"First Edition","Feature":"Doubleday","ISBN":"0385542364","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"955","Length":"649","Weight":"135","Width":"116"},"Label":"Doubleday","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2695","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$26.95"},"Manufacturer":"Doubleday","MPN":"611652","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"320","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"920","Weight":"135","Width":"610"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"611652","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-08-02","Publisher":"Doubleday","ReleaseDate":"2016-08-02","Studio":"Doubleday","Title":"The Underground Railroad (Pulitzer Prize Winner) (National Book Award Winner) (Oprah's Book Club): A Novel"}}}},{"id":"0385535597","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2036,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$20.36"},"asin":"0385535597","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical/dp/0385535597?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0385535597","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical/dp/0385535597?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0385535597","salesRank":52569,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51koXOUOy6L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51koXOUOy6L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right","similar":["1101980966","0385526393","1455518735","1538728753","1631491628","1524762938","1501174169","1501175513","0316484814","0307456293"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0385535597&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A14Z&v=2&sig=pVzOyGh5C%252BWBLTrAmPAcy17UJYydABqRnlJmmmpkR0o%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Why is America living in an age of profound economic inequality? Why, despite the desperate need to address climate change, have even modest environmental efforts been defeated again and again? Why have protections for employees been decimated? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers?<br>      The conventional answer is that a popular uprising against “big government” led to the ascendancy of a broad-based conservative movement. But as Jane Mayer shows in this powerful, meticulously reported history, a network of exceedingly wealthy people with extreme libertarian views bankrolled a systematic, step-by-step plan to fundamentally alter the American political system.  <br>      The network has brought together some of the richest people on the planet. Their core beliefs—that taxes are a form of tyranny; that government oversight of business is an assault on freedom—are sincerely held. But these beliefs also advance their personal and corporate interests: Many of their companies have run afoul of federal pollution, worker safety, securities, and tax laws.<br>      The chief figures in the network are Charles and David Koch, whose father made his fortune in part by building oil refineries in Stalin’s Russia and Hitler’s Germany. The patriarch later was a founding member of the John Birch Society, whose politics were so radical it believed Dwight Eisenhower was a communist. The brothers were schooled in a political philosophy that asserted the only role of government is to provide security and to enforce property rights.  <br>      When libertarian ideas proved decidedly unpopular with voters, the Koch brothers and their allies chose another path. If they pooled their vast resources, they could fund an interlocking array of organizations that could work in tandem to influence and ultimately control academic institutions, think tanks, the courts, statehouses, Congress, and, they hoped, the presidency. Richard Mellon Scaife, the mercurial heir to banking and oil fortunes, had the brilliant insight that most of their political activities could be written off as tax-deductible “philanthropy.”<br>      These organizations were given innocuous names such as Americans for Prosperity. Funding sources were hidden whenever possible. This process reached its apotheosis with the allegedly populist Tea Party movement, abetted mightily by the <i>Citizens United</i> decision—a case conceived of by legal advocates funded by the network.<br>      The political operatives the network employs are disciplined, smart, and at times ruthless. Mayer documents instances in which people affiliated with these groups hired private detectives to impugn whistle-blowers, journalists, and even government investigators. And their efforts have been remarkably successful. Libertarian views on taxes and regulation, once far outside the mainstream and still rejected by most Americans, are ascendant in the majority of state governments, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Meaningful environmental, labor, finance, and tax reforms have been stymied.  <br>      Jane Mayer spent five years conducting hundreds of interviews-including with several sources within the network-and scoured public records, private papers, and court proceedings in reporting this book. In a taut and utterly convincing narrative, she traces the byzantine trail of the billions of dollars spent by the network and provides vivid portraits of the colorful figures behind the new American oligarchy.<br>      <i>Dark Money</i> is a book that must be read by anyone who cares about the future of American democracy."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"United States","id":"4853"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Conservatism & Liberalism","id":"5571265011"},{"name":"History & Theory","id":"11086"},{"name":"National","id":"720030"},{"name":"General","id":"11109"},{"name":"Elections","id":"16023061"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jane Mayer","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Doubleday","EAN":"9780385535595","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780385535595"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Doubleday","ISBN":"0385535597","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"950","Length":"640","Weight":"152","Width":"130"},"Label":"Doubleday","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$29.95"},"Manufacturer":"Doubleday","MPN":"44208041","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"464","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"150","Length":"940","Weight":"175","Width":"620"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"44208041","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-01-19","Publisher":"Doubleday","ReleaseDate":"2016-01-19","Studio":"Doubleday","Title":"Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right"}}}},{"id":"0553448188","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1166,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$11.66"},"asin":"0553448188","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Novel-Han-Kang/dp/0553448188?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0553448188","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Novel-Han-Kang/dp/0553448188?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0553448188","salesRank":203085,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Aq7KXJiIL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Aq7KXJiIL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"324"},"title":"The Vegetarian: A Novel","similar":["0525429638","1101906723","1101874023","1627795944","080508908X","0812994825","1590514882","0385542364","0553447432","1594203989"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0553448188&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A14Z&v=2&sig=vt9Do8NTOrJ1pQJ7gS9Eo8csOKtJiWlNQUnsgxAXXkM%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>Winner of the 2016 Man Booker International Prize<br><b><br>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review • Publisher's Weekly <b><b><i>•  Buzzfeed <b><b><i>•  Entertainment Weekly <b><b><i>•  Time <b><b><i>•  Wall Street Journal <b><b><i>•  Bustle <b><b><i>•  Elle <b><b><i>•  The Economist <b><b><i>•  Slate <b><b><i>•  The Huffington Post <b><b><i>• The St. Louis Dispatch <b><b><i>•  Electric Literature</i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></i><br></b><br>Featured in the <i>New York Times</i> selection of \"15 remarkable books by women that are shaping the way we read and write fiction in the 21st century\" <br><br>A beautiful, unsettling novel about rebellion and taboo, violence and eroticism, and the twisting metamorphosis of a soul</b><br><b> </b><br>Before the nightmares began, Yeong-hye and her husband lived an ordinary, controlled life.

In the lush and vivid prose for which she has become famous, Conde has constructed a Guadeloupean wake for Francis Sancher.  Retaining the full color and vibrance of Conde's homeland, <i>Crossing the Mangrove</i> pays homage to Guadeloupe in both subject and structure."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Cultural Heritage","id":"8946929011"},{"name":"Small Town & Rural","id":"13922576011"},{"name":"Contemporary","id":"10129"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Maryse Conde","Binding":"Paperback","Creator":"Richard Philcox","EAN":"9780385476331","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780385476331"},"Edition":"1st Anchor Books ed","ISBN":"0385476337","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"830","Length":"550","Weight":"44","Width":"60"},"Label":"Anchor","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$16.00"},"Manufacturer":"Anchor","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"207","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"63","Length":"819","Weight":"44","Width":"551"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1995-02-01","Publisher":"Anchor","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-01","Studio":"Anchor","Title":"Crossing the Mangrove"}}}},{"id":"0140443584","data":{"width":51.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1229,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$12.29"},"asin":"0140443584","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Pierre-Jean-Penguin-Classics-Maupassant/dp/0140443584?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0140443584","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Pierre-Jean-Penguin-Classics-Maupassant/dp/0140443584?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0140443584","salesRank":1179775,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516cZFk752L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"103"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516cZFk752L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"323"},"title":"Pierre and Jean (Penguin Classics)","similar":["0140448004","0385476337","0140449728","0307278581","0199536481","015675780X","0156795027","0140448128","0140443150","014044243X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0140443584&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A15Z&v=2&sig=11uHnrJb6Eevs%252FYjbhNeCXNnkZaRfnLLDCb8e%252FKumx8%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"An intensely personal story of suspicion, jealousy, and family love, this novel shows the influence of such masters as Zola and Flaubert on Maupassant's writings.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The story of Lucien Chardon, a young poet from Angoulême who tries desperately to make a name for himself in Paris, is a brilliantly realistic and boldly satirical portrait of provincial manners and aristocratic life. Handsome and ambitious but naïve, Lucien is patronized by the beau monde as represented by Madame de Bargeton and her cousin, the formidable Marquise d'Espard, only to be duped by them. Denied the social rank he thought would be his, Lucien discards his poetic aspirations and turns to hack journalism; his descent into Parisian low life ultimately leads to his own death.<br><br>\"Balzac was both a greedy child and an indefatigable observer of a greedy age, at once a fantastic and a genius, yet possessing a simple core of common sense,\" noted V.

As much as anyone in the modern era, he changed human thought, and his influence is still felt in virtually all aspects of our lives. This new edition, larger and more varied than the previous ones, includes more of Darwin's own work and also presents the most recent research and scholarship on all aspects of Darwin’s legacy. The biological sciences, as well as social thought, philosophy, ethics, religion, and literature, have all been shaped and reshaped by evolutionary concepts.<br /><br /> Excerpts from the most important books and articles of recent years confirm this Darwinian heritage. New work by Richard Dawkins, Edward O. Wilson, Kevin Padian, Eugene C. Scott, Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, Michael Ruse, Frans de Waal, Noretta Koertge, George C. Williams, George Levine, Stephen Jay Gould, Gillian Beer, Ernst Mayr, and many others illuminates this exciting intellectual history. A wide-ranging new introduction by the editor provides context and coherence to this rich body of engaging material, much of which will be shaping human thought well into the new century.<br /><br /> This edition will be useful to scientists and historians alike: \"The Norton <em>Darwin</em> explains Darwinian evolution and illustrates the social and intellectual conflicts of the past two centuries better than any other book that I am aware of.\" (Charles Taylor, Professor of Biology, Ecology, and Evolution, University of California, Los Angeles)<br /><br /> And it will be of great value to the humanities and social sciences as well: \"The edition provides the sharpest and most exciting access to Darwin we have ever had. It shows all of us interested in the heart of our intellectual heritage how that heritage is sustained, manipulated, and honored.\" (James R. Kincaid, Aerol Arnold Professor of English, University of Southern California)<br /><br /> A Selected Bibliography and an Index are included."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Environmentalists & Naturalists","id":"9681288011"},{"name":"British & Irish","id":"10159367011"},{"name":"Biology","id":"226688"},{"name":"Evolution","id":"13824"},{"name":"English Literature","id":"491408"},{"name":"Biology & Life Sciences","id":"491702"}],"attributes":{"Binding":"Paperback","Creator":"Philip Appleman","EAN":"9780393958492","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780393958492"},"Edition":"3rd","ISBN":"0393958493","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"930","Length":"560","Weight":"135","Width":"90"},"Label":"W.

During the War of the Seven Against Thebes, Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus, learns that her brothers have killed each other, having been forced onto opposing sides of the battle. When Creon, king of Thebes, grants burial of one but not the \"treacherous\" other, Antigone defies his order, believing it her duty to bury all of her close kin. Enraged, Creon condemns her to death, and his soldiers wall her up in a tomb. While Creon eventually agrees to Antigone's release, it is too late: She takes her own life, initiating a tragic repetition of events in her family's history.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Ancient & Classical","id":"2168"},{"name":"Tragedy","id":"15991421"},{"name":"Poetry","id":"10248"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Sophocles","Binding":"Paperback","Creator":"Seamus Heaney","EAN":"9780374530075","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780374530075"},"Edition":"First","ISBN":"0374530076","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"815","Length":"553","Weight":"26","Width":"28"},"Label":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1300","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$13.00"},"Manufacturer":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"96","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"40","Length":"790","Weight":"25","Width":"540"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2005-11-03","Publisher":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","ReleaseDate":"2005-10-13","Studio":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","Title":"The Burial at Thebes: A Version of Sophocles' Antigone"}}}},{"id":"0321794265","data":{"width":59.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":11783,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$117.83"},"asin":"0321794265","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Life-Earth-Physiology-10th/dp/0321794265?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321794265","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Life-Earth-Physiology-10th/dp/0321794265?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0321794265","salesRank":27447,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nk6kf8uHL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"119"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nk6kf8uHL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"372"},"title":"Biology: Life on Earth with Physiology (10th Edition)","similar":["0134157249","0495559725","1451669410","155665491X","140003342X","0205803504","0133923002","0133611264","0486287769","0030661498"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0321794265&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A15Z&v=2&sig=iD%252FVv2%252FZ7%252FOIJVfFTMgiRtfm6rUnK9z4mbN2vV5P7lA%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\"> <B> <I>Biology: Life on Earth with Physiology,</I> </B> <B> Tenth Edition</B> continues this book’s tradition of engaging non-majors biology students with real-world applications and inquiry-based pedagogy that fosters a lifetime of discovery and scientific literacy.  </P> <P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\"> </P> <P style=\"MARGIN: 0px\"> <B> <I>Biology: Life on Earth with Physiology,</I> </B> <B> Tenth Edition </B>maintains the friendly writing style the book is known for and continues to incorporate true and relevant stories in every chapter in the form of the Case Study, Case Study Continued, and Case Study Revisited features.

From 9/11 to the Great Recession, the Syrian civil war, the Ebola epidemic, growing inequality, racial unrest and bitterly contested elections, the world seems to be sinking into chaos and hatred. Moralizing commentators tell us that the decline of religious belief and close-knit communities has left us spiritually adrift, without a grounding in moral values, so it's no wonder we're suffering through an epidemic of loneliness, unhappiness and suicide. and then there are the futurologists who speculate on what will finish us off first: resource wars, nuclear annihilation, unstoppable climate change or robots that steal our jobs, enslave us and turn us into raw materials. But, as Steven Pinker argues in this landmark new book, we do not truly inhabit a dystopia of deprivation and violence: In fact, every global measure of human flourishing is on the rise. We're living longer, healthier, safer and more affluent lives-not just in the West, but worldwide. Why? In Enlightenment Now, Pinker proposes that human progress is the gift of a coherent value system that many of us embrace without even knowing it. The values of the Enlightenment underlie all our modern institutions and deserve credit for the stupendous progress we have made. The progress we have enjoyed is not, of course, an excuse for complacency: Some of the challenges we face today are unprecedented in their complexity and scope. The way to deal with these challenges, Pinker argues, is to treat them as problems to solve, as we have solved other problems in our past. Putting the case for an Enlightenment newly recharged for the 21st century, Pinker shows how, by using our faculties of reason and sympathy to understand the world and to enhance human flourishing, we can tackle problems that inevitably come with being products of evolution in an entropic universe."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Subjects","id":"1000"}],"attributes":{"Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780525559023","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780525559023"},"Feature":["Enlightenment Now","Enlightenment Now Steven Pinker"],"IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0525559027","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"610","Length":"917","Width":"157"},"Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"MPN":"49081884","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"160","Length":"890","Weight":"159","Width":"610"},"PartNumber":"49081884","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","Title":"Enlightenment Now"}}}},{"id":"0812973038","data":{"width":51,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1320,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$13.20"},"asin":"0812973038","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Progress-Paradox-Better-While-People/dp/0812973038?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0812973038","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Progress-Paradox-Better-While-People/dp/0812973038?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0812973038","salesRank":945071,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ckq3HK1QL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"102"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ckq3HK1QL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"320"},"title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse","similar":["161039741X","030021264X","0393350649","022627165X","1610396480","1250107814","0525427570","0393239357","0872205541","022608194X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0812973038&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A17Z&v=2&sig=N4TNmUXsDQWozRV%252BB0bX91eVWaTCNNPnbTuH%252BWGqMiQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"In <i>The Progress Paradox</i>, Gregg Easterbrook draws upon three decades of wide-ranging research and thinking to make the persuasive assertion that almost all aspects of Western life have vastly improved in the past century–and yet today, most men and women feel less happy than in previous generations.<br><br>Detailing the emerging science of “positive psychology,” which seeks to understand what causes a person’s sense of well-being, Easterbrook offers an alternative to our culture of crisis and complaint. He makes a compelling case that optimism, gratitude, and acts of forgiveness not only make modern life more fulfilling but are actually in our self-interest. An affirming and constructive way of seeing life anew, <i>The Progress Paradox</i> will change the way you think about your place in the world–and about our collective ability to make it better."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"Ordinary middle-class Americans have often tried to assuage their jealousy of the rich by repeating the axiom \"money can't buy happiness\" to themselves. But according to <I>New Republic</I> senior editor Gregg Easterbrook, \"the rich\" are, in fact, those same ordinary middle-class Americans and no, they're not happy at all. Wages have soared over the past fifty years and regular citizens own large homes, new cars, and luxuries aplenty. Better still, the environment, with a few exceptions, is getting cleaner, crime is on the decline, and diseases are being wiped out as life span increases. So why do people report a sense that things are getting steadily worse and that catastrophe is imminent? Easterbrook presents a few psychological rationales, including \"choice anxiety,\" where the vastness of society's options is a burden, and \"abundance denial,\" where people somehow manage to convince themselves that they are deprived of material comforts. The sooner we accept how good we have it, the better off the whole world will be, he says, because if we would just realize that we have this wealth, we could be using it to alleviate hunger, provide health care for the millions who lack it, and otherwise address the ills that actually do exist. While at times the book's attempts to make the world a better place seem a bit of a stretch, it's admirable that Easterbrook is willing to make that stretch and not suggest people simply light up cigars and bask in their newly discovered joys. One might look a bit askance at some of Easterbrook's sunny perspectives on our societal fortunes--he celebrates rampant consumerism while skating past the rampant consumer debt that lies beneath it, for instance--but it's hard to deny that the pessimistic viewpoint is much more widely stated than that of optimists. Is the glass really half empty or should we, as Easterbrook indicates, enjoy the wonderful world in which we secretly live? --<I>John Moe</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Happiness","id":"4739"},{"name":"Personal Transformation","id":"4745"},{"name":"Class","id":"271633011"},{"name":"Politics & Government","id":"5571255011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Gregg Easterbrook","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Easterbrook, Gregg","EAN":"9780812973037","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780812973037","8601200384857"]},"Edition":"First Paperback Edition","ISBN":"0812973038","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"810","Length":"520","Weight":"66","Width":"90"},"Label":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$16.00"},"Manufacturer":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","MPN":"9780812973037","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"400","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"790","Weight":"70","Width":"520"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780812973037","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2004-11-09","Publisher":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","ReleaseDate":"2004-11-09","Studio":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","Title":"The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse"}}}},{"id":"0393246310","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1827,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$18.27"},"asin":"0393246310","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Behemoth-History-Factory-Making-Modern/dp/0393246310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0393246310","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Behemoth-History-Factory-Making-Modern/dp/0393246310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0393246310","salesRank":42874,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Fr8ZdNL-L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Fr8ZdNL-L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"328"},"title":"Behemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World","similar":["0871407124","1635570220","0393242358","1501105353","0062652559","1501102370","0674979524","0691170819","0060517603","0735221863"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0393246310&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A17Z&v=2&sig=WNcv9uKlo4CqINw3%252Bk8xdqnMjmFOTlNw4ceFlSUnyx0%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><strong>A sweeping, global history of the rise of the factory and its effects on society.</strong></p><p>We live in a factory-made world: modern life is built on three centuries of advances in factory production, efficiency, and technology. But giant factories have also fueled our fears about the future since their beginnings, when William Blake called them \"dark Satanic mills.\" Many factories that operated over the last two centuries―such as Homestead, River Rouge, and Foxconn―were known for the labor exploitation and class warfare they engendered, not to mention the environmental devastation caused by factory production from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution up to today.</p><p>In a major work of scholarship that is also wonderfully accessible, celebrated historian Joshua B. Freeman tells the story of the factory and examines how it has reflected both our dreams and our nightmares of industrialization and social change. He whisks readers from the textile mills in England that powered the Industrial Revolution and the factory towns of New England to the colossal steel and car plants of twentieth-century America, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union and on to today’s behemoths making sneakers, toys, and cellphones in China and Vietnam.</p><p>The giant factory, Freeman shows, led a revolution that transformed human life and the environment. He traces arguments about factories and social progress through such critics and champions as Marx and Engels, Charles Dickens, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Ford, and Joseph Stalin. He chronicles protests against standard industry practices from unions and workers’ rights groups that led to shortened workdays, child labor laws, protection for organized labor, and much more.</p><p>In <em>Behemoth</em>, Freeman also explores how factories became objects of great wonder that both inspired and horrified artists and writers in their time. He examines representations of factories in the work of Charles Sheeler, Margaret Bourke-White, Charlie Chaplin, Diego Rivera, and Edward Burtynsky.</p><p><em>Behemoth</em> tells the grand story of global industry from the Industrial Revolution to the present. It is a magisterial work on factories and the people whose labor made them run. And it offers a piercing perspective on how factories have shaped our societies and the challenges we face now.</p> 30 illustrations"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Industrial Relations","id":"16233431"},{"name":"Manufacturing","id":"10020697011"},{"name":"World","id":"5035"},{"name":"History","id":"7976021011"},{"name":"History of Technology","id":"14637"},{"name":"Business & Finance","id":"468220"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Joshua B.

In this book, Anthony Chemero describes this nonrepresentational approach (which he terms radical embodied cognitive science), puts it in historical and conceptual context, and applies it to traditional problems in the philosophy of mind. Radical embodied cognitive science is a direct descendant of the American naturalist psychology of William James and John Dewey, and follows them in viewing perception and cognition to be understandable only in terms of action in the environment. Chemero argues that cognition should be described in terms of agent-environment dynamics rather than in terms of computation and representation. After outlining this orientation to cognition, Chemero proposes a methodology: dynamical systems theory, which would explain things dynamically and without reference to representation. He also advances a background theory: Gibsonian ecological psychology, “shored up” and clarified. Chemero then looks at some traditional philosophical problems (reductionism, epistemological skepticism, metaphysical realism, consciousness) through the lens of radical embodied cognitive science and concludes that the comparative ease with which it resolves these problems, combined with its empirical promise, makes this approach to cognitive science a rewarding one. “Jerry Fodor is my favorite philosopher,” Chemero writes in his preface, adding, “I think that Jerry Fodor is wrong about nearly everything.” With this book, Chemero explains nonrepresentational, dynamical, ecological cognitive science as clearly and as rigorously as Jerry Fodor explained computational cognitive science in his classic work The Language of Thought.</P>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","id":"573358"},{"name":"Cognitive","id":"15811861"},{"name":"Criticism","id":"886132"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Anthony Chemero","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Brand: A Bradford Book","EAN":"9780262516471","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780262516471"},"Edition":"Reprint","Feature":"Used Book in Good Condition","ISBN":"0262516470","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Weight":"70","Width":"44"},"Label":"A Bradford Book","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2400","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$24.00"},"Manufacturer":"A Bradford Book","MPN":"9780262516471","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"272","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"60","Length":"860","Weight":"80","Width":"570"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780262516471","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2011-08-19","Publisher":"A Bradford Book","Studio":"A Bradford Book","Title":"Radical Embodied Cognitive Science (A Bradford Book)"}}}},{"id":"0471152803","data":{"width":58.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":7758,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$77.58"},"asin":"0471152803","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Hedging-Managing-Vanilla-Options/dp/0471152803?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0471152803","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Hedging-Managing-Vanilla-Options/dp/0471152803?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0471152803","salesRank":94342,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WS-%2BButKL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"117"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WS-%2BButKL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"366"},"title":"Dynamic Hedging: Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options","similar":["0071818774","0465043577","042528462X","0399590455","111834703X","0471792519","0812982401","9814383139","1118959167","1118347137"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0471152803&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A19Z&v=2&sig=4lEKyhD164g3KxJ92Y4kVQaN9hHBxWk3uQB8K5Pn54c%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Dynamic Hedging is the definitive source on derivatives risk.

After four decades spent ascending to the top of the investment management profession, he is today sought out by the world's leading value investors, and his client memos brim with insightful commentary and a time-tested, fundamental philosophy. Now for the first time, all readers can benefit from Marks's wisdom, concentrated into a single volume that speaks to both the amateur and seasoned investor. <p>Informed by a lifetime of experience and study, <em>The Most Important Thing</em> explains the keys to successful investment and the pitfalls that can destroy capital or ruin a career. Utilizing passages from his memos to illustrate his ideas, Marks teaches by example, detailing the development of an investment philosophy that fully acknowledges the complexities of investing and the perils of the financial world. Brilliantly applying insight to today's volatile markets, Marks offers a volume that is part memoir, part creed, with a number of broad takeaways.</p> <p>Marks expounds on such concepts as \"second-level thinking,\" the price/value relationship, patient opportunism, and defensive investing.

With high stock and bond prices and the rising cost of housing, the post-subprime boom may well turn out to be another illustration of Shiller's influential argument that psychologically driven volatility is an inherent characteristic of all asset markets. In other words, <i>Irrational Exuberance</i> is as relevant as ever. Previous editions covered the stock and housing markets―and famously predicted their crashes. This edition expands its coverage to include the bond market, so that the book now addresses all of the major investment markets. It also includes updated data throughout, as well as Shiller's 2013 Nobel Prize lecture, which places the book in broader context. In addition to diagnosing the causes of asset bubbles, <i>Irrational Exuberance</i> recommends urgent policy changes to lessen their likelihood and severity―and suggests ways that individuals can decrease their risk before the next bubble bursts.

The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck?<br><br>Even the best decision doesn't yield the best outcome every time. There's always an element of luck that you can't control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making? <br><br>Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it's difficult to say \"I'm not sure\" in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don't always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don't always lead to bad outcomes.<br><br>By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you don't, you'll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You'll become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","id":"573358"},{"name":"Cognitive","id":"15811861"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Annie Duke","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780735216358","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780735216358"},"ISBN":"0735216355","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"854","Length":"578","Weight":"99","Width":"100"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$26.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"288","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"98","Length":"850","Weight":"91","Width":"587"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-02-06","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2018-02-06","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts"}}}},{"id":"081297381X","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1223,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$12.23"},"asin":"081297381X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=081297381X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=081297381X","salesRank":5167,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41w4yuUG1mL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41w4yuUG1mL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"324"},"title":"The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: \"On Robustness and Fragility\" (Incerto)","similar":["0812979680","0812975219","042528462X","0241300657","0812982401","0374533555","1305585313","039335279X","1118138597","0190858982"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=081297381X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A19Z&v=2&sig=O82tKNLn%252Fd1N4OsVGD09J8qrJ86s1yhiNHzPg8ifu60%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"A black swan is an event, positive or negative, that is deemed improbable yet causes massive consequences.

All four volumes—<i>Antifragile, The Black Swan, Fooled by Randomness, </i>and the expanded edition of<i> The Bed of Procrustes, </i>updated with more than 50 percent new material—are now together in one boxed set.<br>  <br> <b>ANTIFRAGILE</b><br>  <br> <b>“Startling . . . richly crammed with insights, stories, fine phrases and intriguing asides.”<i>—The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br>  <br> Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, many things in life benefit from disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls “antifragile” is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better. What is crucial is that the antifragile loves errors, as it incurs small harm and large benefits from them. Spanning politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine in an interdisciplinary and erudite style, <i>Antifragile</i> is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.<br>  <br> <b>THE BLACK SWAN</b><br> <b> </b><br> <b>“[A book] that altered modern thinking.”—<i>The Times</i> (London)</b><br>  <br> A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random and more predictable. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. In this groundbreaking and prophetic book, Taleb shows that black swan events underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives, and yet we—especially the experts—are blind to them.<br>  <br> <b>FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS</b><br> <b> </b><br> <b>“[<i>Fooled by Randomness</i>] is to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther’s ninety-five theses were to the Catholic Church.”—Malcolm Gladwell, <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br>  <br> Are we capable of distinguishing the fortunate charlatan from the genuine visionary? Must we always try to uncover nonexistent messages in random events? <i>Fooled by Randomness</i> is about luck: more precisely, about how we perceive luck in our personal and professional experiences. Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous forum in which luck is mistaken for skill—the markets—<i>Fooled by Randomness</i> is an irreverent, eye-opening, and endlessly entertaining exploration of one of the least understood forces in our lives.<br>  <br> <b>THE BED OF PROCRUSTES</b><br> <b> </b><br> <b>“Taleb’s crystalline nuggets of thought stand alone like esoteric poems.”—<i>Financial Times</i></b><br>  <br> This collection of aphorisms and meditations expresses Taleb’s major ideas in ways you least expect. <i>The Bed of Procrustes</i> takes its title from Greek mythology: the story of a man who made his visitors fit his bed to perfection by either stretching them or cutting their limbs. With a rare combination of pointed wit and potent wisdom, Taleb plows through human illusions, contrasting the classical views of courage, elegance, and erudition against the modern diseases of nerdiness, philistinism, and phoniness."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Corporate Finance","id":"2607"},{"name":"Stocks","id":"2674"},{"name":"Social

Description","content":"<p>In this revised, updated, and expanded edition of his <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert Shiller, who warned of both the tech and housing bubbles, cautions that signs of irrational exuberance among investors have only increased since the 2008–9 financial crisis. With high stock and bond prices and the rising cost of housing, the post-subprime boom may well turn out to be another illustration of Shiller's influential argument that psychologically driven volatility is an inherent characteristic of all asset markets. In other words, <i>Irrational Exuberance</i> is as relevant as ever. Previous editions covered the stock and housing markets―and famously predicted their crashes. This edition expands its coverage to include the bond market, so that the book now addresses all of the major investment markets. It also includes updated data throughout, as well as Shiller's 2013 Nobel Prize lecture, which places the book in broader context. In addition to diagnosing the causes of asset bubbles, <i>Irrational Exuberance</i> recommends urgent policy changes to lessen their likelihood and severity―and suggests ways that individuals can decrease their risk before the next bubble bursts. No one whose future depends on a retirement account, a house, or other investments can afford not to read this book.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economic Conditions","id":"2587"},{"name":"Economic History","id":"2589"},{"name":"Environmental Economics","id":"1043856"},{"name":"Finance","id":"2604"},{"name":"Bonds","id":"2666"},{"name":"Stocks","id":"2674"},{"name":"Investments","id":"2653"},{"name":"Economics","id":"491584"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Robert J.

Following the low-budget Oakland Athletics, their larger-than-life general manger, Billy Beane, and the strange brotherhood of amateur baseball enthusiasts, Michael Lewis has written not only \"the single most influential baseball book ever\" (Rob Neyer, <em>Slate</em>) but also what \"may be the best book ever written on business\" (<em>Weekly Standard</em>).<br /></p> \"I wrote this book because I fell in love with a story. The story concerned a small group of undervalued professional baseball players and executives, many of whom had been rejected as unfit for the big leagues, who had turned themselves into one of the most successful franchises in Major League Baseball. But the idea for the book came well before I had good reason to write it—before I had a story to fall in love with. It began, really, with an innocent question: how did one of the poorest teams in baseball, the Oakland Athletics, win so many games?\"<br /> <br /> With these words Michael Lewis launches us into the funniest, smartest, and most contrarian book since, well, since<em> Liar's Poker</em>. <em>Moneyball</em> is a quest for something as elusive as the Holy Grail, something that money apparently can't buy: the secret of success in baseball. The logical places to look would be the front offices of major league teams, and the dugouts, perhaps even in the minds of the players themselves. Lewis mines all these possibilities—his intimate and original portraits of big league ballplayers are alone worth the price of admission—but the real jackpot is a cache of numbers—numbers!—collected over the years by a strange brotherhood of amateur baseball enthusiasts: software engineers, statisticians, Wall Street analysts, lawyers and physics professors.<br /> <br /> What these geek numbers show—no, prove—is that the traditional yardsticks of success for players and teams are fatally flawed. Even the box score misleads us by ignoring the crucial importance of the humble base-on-balls. This information has been around for years, and nobody inside Major League Baseball paid it any mind. And then came Billy Beane, General Manager of the Oakland Athletics.<br /> <br /> Billy paid attention to those numbers —with the second lowest payroll in baseball at his disposal he had to—and this book records his astonishing experiment in finding and fielding a team that nobody else wanted. <em>Moneyball</em> is a roller coaster ride: before the 2002 season opens, Oakland must relinquish its three most prominent (and expensive) players, is written off by just about everyone, and then comes roaring back to challenge the American League record for consecutive wins.<br /> <br /> In a narrative full of fabulous characters and brilliant excursions into the unexpected, Michael Lewis shows us how and why the new baseball knowledge works. He also sets up a sly and hilarious morality tale: Big Money, like Goliath, is always supposed to win...how can we not cheer for David?<br /><br />\"One of the best baseball—and management—books out....Deserves a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\"—<em>Forbes</em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Sports","id":"8298059011"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Baseball","id":"16315"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Michael Lewis","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"W.W.

How can they create products that they are sure customers want to buy? Can innovation be more than a game of hit and miss? Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has the answer. A generation ago, Christensen revolutionized business with his groundbreaking theory of disruptive innovation. Now, he goes further, offering powerful new insights. <br /><br />After years of research, Christensen and his co-authors have come to one critical conclusion: our long held maxim--that understanding the customer is the crux of innovation--is wrong. Customers don't buy products or services; they \"hire\" them to do a job. Understanding customers does not drive innovation success, he argues. Understanding customer jobs does. The \"Jobs to Be Done\" approach can be seen in some of the world's most respected companies and fast-growing startups, including Amazon, Intuit, Uber, Airbnb, and Chobani yogurt, to name just a few. But this book is not about celebrating these successes--it's about predicting new ones. <br /><br />Christensen, Hall, Dillon, and Duncan contend that by understanding what causes customers to \"hire\" a product or service, any business can improve its innovation track record, creating products that customers not only want to hire, but that they'll pay premium prices to bring into their lives. Jobs theory offers new hope for growth to companies frustrated by their hit and miss efforts.<br /><br />This book carefully lays down the authors' provocative framework, providing a comprehensive explanation of the theory and why it is predictive, how to use it in the real world--and, most importantly, how not to squander the insights it provides."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Service","id":"16233451"},{"name":"Consumer Behavior","id":"2700"},{"name":"Education & Reference","id":"2732"},{"name":"Research & Development","id":"10020723011"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Clayton M.

They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?\"</p><p>What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked?</p><p>By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.</p><p>Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, <em>Built to Last</em> provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Company Profiles","id":"2542"},{"name":"Environmental Economics","id":"1043856"},{"name":"Sustainable Development","id":"2601"},{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Jim Collins","Jerry I.

Description","content":"Expanded, updated, and more relevant than ever, this bestselling business classic by two internationally renowned management analysts describes a business system for the twenty-first century.<BR><BR>Expanded, updated, and more relevant than ever, this bestselling business classic by two internationally renowned management analysts describes a business system for the twenty-first century that supersedes the mass production system of Ford, the financial control system of Sloan, and the strategic system of Welch and GE. It is based on the Toyota (lean) model, which combines operational excellence with value-based strategies to produce steady growth through a wide range of economic conditions.<BR> <BR>In contrast with the crash-and-burn performance of companies trumpeted by business gurus in the 1990s, the firms profiled in <I>Lean Thinking</I> -- from tiny Lantech to midsized Wiremold to niche producer Porsche to gigantic Pratt & Whitney -- have kept on keeping on, largely unnoticed, along a steady upward path through the market turbulence and crushed dreams of the early twenty-first century. Meanwhile, the leader in lean thinking -- Toyota -- has set its sights on leadership of the global motor vehicle industry in this decade.<BR> <BR>Instead of constantly reinventing business models, lean thinkers go back to basics by asking what the customer really perceives as <I>value.</I> (It's often not at all what existing organizations and assets would suggest.) The next step is to line up value-creating activities for a specific product along a <I>value stream</I> while eliminating activities (usually the majority) that don't add value. Then the lean thinker creates a <I>flow</I> condition in which the design and the product advance smoothly and rapidly at the <I>pull</I> of the customer (rather than the push of the producer). Finally, as flow and pull are implemented, the lean thinker speeds up the cycle of improvement in pursuit of <I>perfection.</I> The first part of this book describes each of these concepts and makes them come alive with striking examples.<BR> <BR><I>Lean Thinking</I> clearly demonstrates that these simple ideas can breathe new life into any company in any industry in any country. But most managers need guidance on how to make the lean leap in their firm. Part II provides a step-by-step action plan, based on in-depth studies of more than fifty lean companies in a wide range of industries across the world.<BR> <BR>Even those readers who believe they have embraced lean thinking will discover in Part III that another dramatic leap is possible by creating an extended lean enterprise for each of their product families that tightly links value-creating activities from raw materials to customer.<BR> <BR>In Part IV, an epilogue to the original edition, the story of lean thinking is brought up-to-date with an enhanced action plan based on the experiences of a range of lean firms since the original publication of <I>Lean Thinking.</I><BR> <BR><I>Lean Thinking</I> does not provide a new management \"program\" for the one-minute manager. Instead, it offers a new method of thinking, of being, and, above all, of doing for the serious long-term manager -- a method that is changing the world."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"In the revised and updated edition of <I>Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation</I>, authors James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones provide a thoughtful expansion upon their value-based business system based on the Toyota model. Along the way they update their action plan in light of new research and the increasing globalization of manufacturing, and they revisit some of their key case studies (most of which still derive, however, from the automotive, aerospace, and other manufacturing industries). <p> The core of the lean model remains the same in the new edition. All businesses must define the \"value\" that they produce as the product that best suits customer needs. The leaders must then identify and clarify the \"value stream,\" the nexus of actions to bring the product through problems solving, information management, and physical transformation tasks. Next, \"lean enterprise\" lines up suppliers with this value stream. \"Flow\" traces the product across departments. \"Pull\" then activates the flow as the business re-orients towards the pull of the customer's needs. Finally, with the company reengineered towards its core value in a flow process, the business re-orients towards \"perfection,\" rooting out all the remaining <I>muda</I> (Japanese for \"waste\") in the system. <p> Despite the authors' claims to \"actionable principles for creating lasting value in any business during any business conditions,\" the lean model is not demonstrated with broad applications in the service or retail industries. But those manager's whose needs resonate with those described in the <I>Lean Thinking</I> case studies will find a host of practical guidelines for streamlining their processes and achieving manufacturing efficiencies. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Economics","id":"2581"},{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategy & Competition","id":"2553"},{"name":"Quality Control","id":"2692"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"}],"attributes":{"Author":["James P.

Stevens, at the end of three decades of service at Darlington Hall, spending a day on a country drive, embarks as well on a journey through the past in an effort to reassure himself that he has served humanity by serving the \"great gentleman,\" Lord Darlington.

In a career that spans the second World War, Stevens is oblivious of the real life that goes on around him -- oblivious, for instance, of the fact that his aristocrat employer is a Nazi sympathizer. Still, there are even larger matters at stake in this heartbreaking, pitch-perfect novel -- namely, Stevens' own ability to allow some bit of life-affirming love into his tightly repressed existence."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Classics","id":"10399"},{"name":"Historical","id":"10177"},{"name":"Contemporary","id":"10129"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Kazuo Ishiguro","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Vintage International","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"FPS-318059"},"Color":"Brown","EAN":"9780679731726","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780679731726"},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"Vintage International","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0679731725","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"797","Length":"516","Weight":"40","Width":"55"},"Label":"Vintage International","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$16.00"},"Manufacturer":"Vintage International","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"245","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"90","Length":"790","Weight":"40","Width":"510"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1990-09-12","Publisher":"Vintage International","ReleaseDate":"1990-09-12","Studio":"Vintage International","Title":"The Remains of the Day"}}}},{"id":"0802121322","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1800,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$18.00"},"asin":"0802121322","link":"https://www.amazon.com/How-Asia-Works-Joe-Studwell/dp/0802121322?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0802121322","url":"https://www.amazon.com/How-Asia-Works-Joe-Studwell/dp/0802121322?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0802121322","salesRank":16401,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QLIBJJI7L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QLIBJJI7L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"How Asia Works","similar":["0802143911","0981848664","1591846803","0393352978","1497644895","1250058783","1119942535","0393310728","0465027660","0190239034"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0802121322&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A20Z&v=2&sig=OY0niNTa2Dz3uysWV9rosXLwevP0JZe3S2d8clmbVRU%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><B>Named by Bill Gates as one of his Top 5 Books of the Year<BR>An <I>Economist</I> Best Book of the Year</B><BR><BR>In the 1980s and 1990s many in the West came to believe in the myth of an East-Asian economic miracle, with countries seen as not just development prodigies but as a unified bloc, culturally and economically similar, and inexorably on the rise.

He expands upon his groundbreaking ideas and searches for answers about life, death, faith and suffering.

Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory-known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (\"meaning\")-holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.<br><br>At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages.

Fabry wrote in the introduction: Many older therapies place responsibility for our difficulties on our early upbringing. Logotherapy is \"education to responsibility.\" Outside influences are important but not all-determining. Within limitations we have a say about who we are and who we want to become. We need never let ourselves be reduced to helpless victims. Consequently, logotherapy-unlike therapies that aim at equilibrium by adjusting patients to society-does not see a tensionless life as a therapeutic goal. Tension is part of living as a human being in a human society. To remain healthy, the unhealthy tensions of body and psyche are to be avoided. But the healthy tension of the spirit strengthens our spiritual muscles. The healthiest tension is between what we are and what we have the vision of growing toward, or, to use Frankl's favorite phrase, \"the tension between being and meaning\" (Psychotherapy and Existentialism, p. 10). The struggle for meaning is not easy. Life does not owe us pleasure; it does offer us meaning. Mental health does not come to those who demand happiness but to those who find meanings; to them happiness comes as a side product. \"It must ensue\" noted Frankl. \"It cannot be pursued\" (Unconscious God, p. 85). Logotherapy maintains and restores mental health by providing a sound view of the human being and the world as we know it. It draws on the huge reservoir of health stored in our specifically human dimension-our creativity, our capacity to love, our reaching out to others, our desire to be useful, our ability to orient to goals, and our will to meaning. Logophilosophy emphasizes what is right with us, what we like about ourselves, our accomplishments, and our peak experiences.

These beliefs were formulated by the Athenian followers of Zeno in the fourth century BC, but it was in Seneca that the Stoics found their most eloquent advocate. Stoicism, as expressed in the Letters, helped ease pagan Rome's transition to Christianity, for it upholds upright ethical ideals and extols virtuous living, as well as expressing disgust for the harsh treatment of slaves and the inhumane slaughter witnessed in the Roman arenas. Seneca's major contribution to a seemingly unsympathetic creed was to transform it into a powerfully moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind. Robin Campbell's distinguished translation captures Seneca's humour and concise, memorable aphorisms and his introduction discusses the tensions between Seneca's philosophy and his turbulent career as adviser to the tyrannical emperor Nero.<br><br>For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Hollingdale in Penguin Classics. Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. Nietzsche's utterance 'God is dead', his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms, and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by, among others, Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority, but in an all-powerful life force: passionate, chaotic and free. Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H.

Former U.S. Poet Laureate Pinsky employs slant rhyme and near rhyme to preserve Dante's <i>terza rima</i> form without distorting the flow of English idiom. The result is a clear and vigorous translation that is also unique, student-friendly, and faithful to the original: \"A brilliant success,\" as Bernard Knox wrote in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>.</p>"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"The one quality that all classic works of literature share is their timelessness. Shakespeare still plays in Peoria 400 years after his death because the stories he dramatized resonate in modern readers' hearts and minds; methods of warfare have changed quite a bit since the Trojan War described by Homer in his <I>Iliad</I>, but the passions and conflicts that shaped such warriors as Achilles, Agamemnon, Patroclus, and Odysseus still find their counterparts today on battlefields from Bosnia to Afghanistan. Likewise, a little travel guide to hell written by the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri in the 13th century remains in print at the end of the 20th century, and it continues to speak to new generations of readers. There have been countless translations of the <I>Inferno</I>, but this one by poet Robert Pinsky is both eloquent and tailored to our times. <p> Yes, this is an epic poem, but don't let that put you off. An excellent introduction provides context for the work, while detailed notes on each canto are a virtual who's who of 13th-century Italian politics, culture, and literature. Best of all, Pinsky's brilliant translation communicates the horror, despair, and terror of hell with such immediacy, you can almost smell the sulfur and feel the heat from the rain of fire as Dante--led by his faithful guide Virgil--descends lower and lower into the pit. Dante's journey through Satan's kingdom must rate as one of the great fictional travel tales of all time, and Pinsky does it great justice."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Foreign Language Fiction","id":"16260301"},{"name":"Medieval","id":"8298099011"},{"name":"Italian","id":"3559094011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Dante","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Farrar Straus Giroux","Creator":["Robert Pinsky","John Freccero"],"EAN":"9780374524524","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780374524524"},"Edition":"Bilingual edition","Feature":"Farrar Straus Giroux","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0374524521","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"786","Length":"546","Weight":"93","Width":"99"},"Label":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"Italian","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"Italian","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"Italian","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1200","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$12.00"},"Manufacturer":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"384","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"102","Length":"780","Weight":"93","Width":"543"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1996-03-30","Publisher":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","ReleaseDate":"1996-03-30","Studio":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","Title":"The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation, Bilingual Edition (Italian Edition)"}}}},{"id":"0679405739","data":{"width":62.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2610,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$26.10"},"asin":"0679405739","link":"https://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Set-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0679405739?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0679405739","url":"https://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Set-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0679405739?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0679405739","salesRank":59154,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CDla%2BVh%2BL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"125"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CDla%2BVh%2BL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"392"},"title":"War and Peace (3 Volume Set)","similar":["0679410031","0679410007","1400041910","0679420290","0307700763","0198800533","0375413928","0375403175","0307271129","0375411224"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0679405739&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A23Z&v=2&sig=H0kyBbn7YAAhCWtiDi9tADPEkC%252BukV2nbvVMd1wMCqA%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>Three-Volume Boxed Set<br>Translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude<br><br><i>War and Peace</i> broadly focuses on Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men. <br><br>As Napoleon's army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds—peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers—as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture.

(The latter is three pages longer and less fun to read.) Fueled by Orwell's intense disillusionment with Soviet Communism, <I>Animal Farm</I> is a nearly perfect piece of writing, both an engaging story and an allegory that actually works. When the downtrodden beasts of Manor Farm oust their drunken human master and take over management of the land, all are awash in collectivist zeal. Everyone willingly works overtime, productivity soars, and for one brief, glorious season, every belly is full. The animals' Seven Commandment credo is painted in big white letters on the barn. All animals are equal. No animal shall drink alcohol, wear clothes, sleep in a bed, or kill a fellow four-footed creature. Those that go upon four legs or wings are friends and the two-legged are, by definition, the enemy. Too soon, however, the pigs, who have styled themselves leaders by virtue of their intelligence, succumb to the temptations of privilege and power. \"We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of the farm depend on us. Day and night, we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.\" While this swinish brotherhood sells out the revolution, cynically editing the Seven Commandments to excuse their violence and greed, the common animals are once again left hungry and exhausted, no better off than in the days when humans ran the farm. Satire <I>Animal Farm</i> may be, but it's a stony reader who remains unmoved when the stalwart workhorse, Boxer, having given his all to his comrades, is sold to the glue factory to buy booze for the pigs. Orwell's view of Communism is bleak indeed, but given the history of the Russian people since 1917, his pessimism has an air of prophecy. <I>--Joyce Thompson</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Satire","id":"4477"},{"name":"Classics","id":"10399"},{"name":"Criticism & Theory","id":"10207"}],"attributes":{"Author":"George Orwell","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["POXM-0151072558","XM-0151072558"]},"EAN":"9780151072552","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780151072552"},"ISBN":"0151072558","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"800","Length":"531","Weight":"51","Width":"66"},"Label":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$18.00"},"Manufacturer":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","MPN":"9780151072552","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"144","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"110","Length":"810","Weight":"65","Width":"560"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780151072552","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1990-11-20","Publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-20","Studio":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","Title":"Animal Farm"}}}},{"id":"0679420398","data":{"width":49.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1561,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$15.61"},"asin":"0679420398","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Farm-George-Orwell/dp/0679420398?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0679420398","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Farm-George-Orwell/dp/0679420398?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0679420398","salesRank":8076,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514h0TdpONL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"99"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514h0TdpONL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"308"},"title":"Animal Farm","similar":["1328869334","0062696122","1451673264","0679437223","0812416317","0143124293","0375415033","0307595048","1411469429","0316769533"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0679420398&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A23Z&v=2&sig=OPx9xifzI2mn%252BLejJzN%252BSqYcVEr9iLnQfYMe%252BpIhO6A%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p> </p><p><i>Animal Farm</i> is the most famous by far of all twentieth-century political allegories.

Joseph Heller's masterpiece about a bomber squadron in the Second World War's Italian theater features a gallery of magnificently strange characters seething with comic energy. The malingering hero, Yossarian, is endlessly inventive in his schemes to save his skin from the horrible chances of war, and his story is studded with incidents and devices (including the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade and the hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule that gives the book its title) that propel the narrative in a headlong satiric rush. But the reason <i>Catch-22</i>'s satire never weakens and its jokes never date stems not from the comedy itself but from the savage, unerring, Swiftian indignation out of which that comedy springs. This fractured anti-epic, with all its aggrieved humanity, has given us the most enduring image we have of modern warfare. <br><br>This hardcover Everyman's Library edition includes an introduction by Malcolm Bradbury, a chronology of the author's life and times, and a select bibliography.

Albert Einstein as a man, however, has been a much harder portrait to paint, and what we know of him as a husband, father, and friend is fragmentary at best. With <i>Einstein: His Life and Universe</i>, Walter Isaacson (author of the bestselling biographies <i>Benjamin Franklin</i> and <i>Kissinger</i>) brings Einstein's experience of life, love, and intellectual discovery into brilliant focus. The book is the first biography to tackle Einstein's enormous volume of personal correspondence that heretofore had been sealed from the public, and it's hard to imagine another book that could do such a richly textured and complicated life as Einstein's the same thoughtful justice. Isaacson is a master of the form and this latest opus is at once arresting and wonderfully revelatory. <i>--Anne Bartholomew</i><BR><BR> <b>Read \"The Light-Beam Rider,\" the first chapter of Walter Isaacson's <i>Einstein: His Life and Universe</i>.</b> <HR class=bucketDivider noShade SIZE=1> <B class=h1>Five Questions for Walter Isaacson</B> <BR><BR><IMG hspace=4 src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/content/Isaacson_Walter_250.jpg\" align=right vspace=4 border=0> <B>Amazon.com:</B> What kind of scientific education did you have to give yourself to be able to understand and explain Einstein's ideas?<BR><BR> <B>Isaacson:</B> I've always loved science, and I had a group of great physicists--such as Brian Greene, Lawrence Krauss, and Murray Gell-Mann--who tutored me, helped me learn the physics, and checked various versions of my book. I also learned the tensor calculus underlying general relativity, but tried to avoid spending too much time on it in the book. I wanted to capture the imaginative beauty of Einstein's scientific leaps, but I hope folks who want to delve more deeply into the science will read Einstein books by such scientists as Abraham Pais, Jeremy Bernstein, Brian Greene, and others.<BR><BR> <B>Amazon.com:</B> That Einstein was a clerk in the Swiss Patent Office when he revolutionized our understanding of the physical world has often been treated as ironic or even absurd. But you argue that in many ways his time there fostered his discoveries. Could you explain? <BR><BR> <B>Isaacson:</B> I think he was lucky to be at the patent office rather than serving as an acolyte in the academy trying to please senior professors and teach the conventional wisdom. As a patent examiner, he got to visualize the physical realities underlying scientific concepts. He had a boss who told him to question every premise and assumption. And as Peter Galison shows in <I>Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps</I>, many of the patent applications involved synchronizing clocks using signals that traveled at the speed of light. So with his office-mate Michele Besso as a sounding board, he was primed to make the leap to special relativity.<BR><BR> <B>Amazon.com:</B> That time in the patent office makes him sound far more like a practical scientist and tinkerer than the usual image of the wild-haired professor, and more like your previous biographical subject, the multitalented but eminently earthly Benjamin Franklin. Did you see connections between them?<BR><BR> <B>Isaacson:</B> I like writing about creativity, and that's what Franklin and Einstein shared. They also had great curiosity and imagination. But Franklin was a more practical man who was not very theoretical, and Einstein was the opposite in that regard. <BR><BR> <B>Amazon.com:</B> Of the many legends that have accumulated around Einstein, what did you find to be least true? Most true? <BR><BR> <B>Isaacson:</B> The least true legend is that he failed math as a schoolboy. He was actually great in math, because he could visualize equations. He knew they were nature's brushstrokes for painting her wonders. For example, he could look at Maxwell's equations and marvel at what it would be like to ride alongside a light wave, and he could look at Max Planck's equations about radiation and realize that Planck's constant meant that light was a particle as well as a wave. The most true legend is how rebellious and defiant of authority he was. You see it in his politics, his personal life, and his science.<BR><BR> <B>Amazon.com:</B> At <i>Time</i> and CNN and the Aspen Institute, you've worked with many of the leading thinkers and leaders of the day. Now that you've had the chance to get to know Einstein so well, did he remind you of anyone from our day who shares at least some of his remarkable qualities? <BR><BR> <B>Isaacson:</B> There are many creative scientists, most notably Stephen Hawking, who wrote the essay on Einstein as \"Person of the Century\" when I was editor of <i>Time</i>. In the world of technology, Steve Jobs has the same creative imagination and ability to think differently that distinguished Einstein, and Bill Gates has the same intellectual intensity. I wish I knew politicians who had the creativity and human instincts of Einstein, or for that matter the wise feel for our common values of Benjamin Franklin. <BR><BR> <HR class=bucketDivider noShade SIZE=1 =\"/\"> <P clear=all><B class=h1>More to Explore</B> <TABLE cellPadding=4 width=\"100%\"> <TBODY> <TR align=middle> <TD width=\"33%\"> <P><IMG src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/074325807X.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg\" border=0><BR><I>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life</I> </P></TD> <TD width=\"33%\"><IMG src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0743286979.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg\" border=0><BR><I>Kissinger: A Biography </I></TD> <TD width=\"33%\"><IMG src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0684837714.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg\" border=0><BR><I>The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made </I></TD> </TR></TBODY></TABLE> <HR class=bucketDivider noShade SIZE=1>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Scientists","id":"2426"},{"name":"World","id":"5035"},{"name":"History & Philosophy","id":"13871"},{"name":"Relativity","id":"14592"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Walter Isaacson","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Simon & Schuster","EAN":"9780743264730","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780743264730"},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"life and thought of Albert Einstein","Format":"Deckle Edge","ISBN":"0743264738","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"625","Weight":"241","Width":"180"},"Label":"Simon & Schuster","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$35.00"},"Manufacturer":"Simon & Schuster","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"675","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"205","Length":"953","Weight":"241","Width":"673"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2007-04-10","Publisher":"Simon & Schuster","ReleaseDate":"2007-04-10","Studio":"Simon & Schuster","Title":"Einstein: His Life and Universe"}}}},{"id":"074325807X","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":659,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$6.59"},"asin":"074325807X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-American-Walter-Isaacson/dp/074325807X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=074325807X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-American-Walter-Isaacson/dp/074325807X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=074325807X","salesRank":2426,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517C-UTkNAL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517C-UTkNAL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"Benjamin Franklin: An American Life","similar":["0743264746","1476708703","1501139150","1501127624","0306812835","1501139169","1451648537","1476728828","1420953869","0743223136"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=074325807X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A25Z&v=2&sig=q3fszwAU%252FlXFI1DrjZzB9W8sZkq9ZW9fR90aqFJkHrw%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"In this authoritative and engrossing full-scale biography, Walter Isaacson, bestselling author of <I>Einstein </I>and <I>Steve Jobs</I>, shows how the most fascinating of America's founders helped define our national character.<BR><BR>Benjamin Franklin is the founding father who winks at us, the one who seems made of flesh rather than marble.

What's more, Isaacson relates in this fluent and entertaining biography, the revolutionary leader represents a political tradition that has been all but forgotten today, one that prizes pragmatism over moralism, religious tolerance over fundamentalist rigidity, and social mobility over class privilege. That broadly democratic sensibility allowed Franklin his contradictions, as Isaacson shows. Though a man of lofty principles, Franklin wasn't shy of using sex to sell the newspapers he edited and published; though far from frivolous, he liked his toys and his mortal pleasures; and though he sometimes gave off a simpleton image, he was a shrewd and even crafty politician. Isaacson doesn't shy from enumerating Franklin’s occasional peccadilloes and shortcomings, in keeping with the iconoclastic nature of our time--none of which, however, stops him from considering Benjamin Franklin \"the most accomplished American of his age,\" and one of the most admirable of any era. And here’s one bit of proof: as a young man, Ben Franklin regularly went without food in order to buy books. His example, as always, is a good one--and this is just the book to buy with the proceeds from the grocery budget. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"United States","id":"2395"},{"name":"American Revolution","id":"9681303011"},{"name":"Political","id":"2397"},{"name":"Scientists","id":"2426"},{"name":"Revolution & Founding","id":"4871"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Walter Isaacson","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Simon Schuster","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["XM-0684807610","POXM-0684807610"]},"EAN":"9780684807614","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601406463493","9780684807614"]},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"In this authoritative and engrossing full-scale biography, Walter Isaacson, bestselling author of Einstein and Steve Jobs, shows how the most fascinating of America's founders helped define our national character.","Format":"Deckle Edge","ISBN":"0684807610","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"625","Weight":"219","Width":"170"},"Label":"Simon & Schuster","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$35.00"},"Manufacturer":"Simon & Schuster","MPN":"16pp colour plate section","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"624","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"169","Length":"961","Weight":"203","Width":"669"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"16pp colour plate section","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2003-07","Publisher":"Simon & Schuster","ReleaseDate":"2003-07-01","Studio":"Simon & Schuster","Title":"Benjamin Franklin: An American Life"}}}},{"id":"0190876735","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2014,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$20.14"},"asin":"0190876735","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Blessed-History-American-Prosperity-Gospel/dp/0190876735?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0190876735","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Blessed-History-American-Prosperity-Gospel/dp/0190876735?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0190876735","salesRank":127433,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41zmZpgA3sL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41zmZpgA3sL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel","similar":["0399592067","0825445078","0062659472","0718022319","0802876412","0986444243","1601429304","0061730580","0735291160","153591520X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0190876735&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A25Z&v=2&sig=lOeQez6x%252FsmC1TJKiNUegj55X%252B9auO0XFtg1drIo7Sw%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"How have millions of American Christians come to measure spiritual progress in terms of their financial status and physical well-being?

Bowler traces the roots of the prosperity gospel: from the touring mesmerists, metaphysical sages, pentecostal healers, business oracles, and princely prophets of the early 20th century; through mid-century positive thinkers like Norman Vincent Peale and revivalists like Oral Roberts and Kenneth Hagin; to today's hugely successful prosperity preachers. Bowler focuses on such contemporary figures as Creflo Dollar, pastor of Atlanta's 30,000-member World Changers Church International; Joel Osteen, known as \"the smiling preacher,\" with a weekly audience of seven million; T.

At almost any moment, day or night, the American public can tune in to these preachers-on TV, radio, podcasts, and in their megachurches-to hear the message that God desires to bless them with wealth and health.

Something didn’t add up.</p><p>It was at this moment, Omalu studying slides of Webster’s brain tissue under a microscope, that the world of contact sports would never be the same: the discovery of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. CTE can result in an array of devastating consequences including deterioration in attention, memory loss, social instability, depression, and even suicide. And Omalu’s discovery of CTE in the brain of an American football player has become the catalyst of a blazing controversy across all contact sports.</p><p>At the center of that controversy stands the unlikely Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian-born American citizen, a mild-mannered, gentle man of faith. It is fascinating that it would take someone on the outside of American culture to make this amazing discovery, and refuse to let it be kept hidden. Dr. Omalu began his life in strife, growing up in war-torn Nigeria. But his medical studies in forensic pathology proved to be a lifeline. It fed his natural curiosity and awakened within a deeper desire to always search for the truth. Who would have thought that such an unexpected character would play such a role in bringing to life this world-changing data?</p><p>In <em>Truth Doesn’t Have a Side</em>, discover the truth about CTE: Its causes and symptoms, how we might keep our children safe and guide professional athletes when CTE sets in. The problem of CTE is coming to light with each new story about an athlete’s concussion problem, and we are likely facing dramatic changes to professional sports. You’ll be inspired by Dr. Bennet Omalu a man driven by his love and concern for the welfare of all people, and his professional vow to speak the truth.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Religious","id":"2398"},{"name":"Medical","id":"2423"},{"name":"Football","id":"2449"},{"name":"Football (American)","id":"16378"},{"name":"Neurology","id":"227210"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Bennet Omalu","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"HarperCollins Christian Pub.","Creator":["Will Smith","Mark Tabb"],"EAN":"9780310351962","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780310351962","0025986351960"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"ZONDERVAN","ISBN":"0310351960","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"929","Length":"638","Weight":"100","Width":"106"},"Label":"Zondervan","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$24.99"},"Manufacturer":"Zondervan","MPN":"17722X","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"304","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"118","Length":"909","Weight":"95","Width":"618"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"17722X","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-08-08","Publisher":"Zondervan","ReleaseDate":"2017-08-08","Studio":"Zondervan","Title":"Truth Doesn't Have a Side: My Alarming Discovery about the Danger of Contact Sports","UPC":"025986351960","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"025986351960"}}}}},{"id":"0812984250","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1425,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.25"},"asin":"0812984250","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Tenth-December-Stories-George-Saunders/dp/0812984250?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0812984250","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Tenth-December-Stories-George-Saunders/dp/0812984250?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0812984250","salesRank":17441,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vxZqUq-JL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vxZqUq-JL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"324"},"title":"Tenth of December: Stories","similar":["1573228729","0812987683","0812985400","159448242X","0812996275","0486270602","0486268756","0190262338","0486434222","0812989635"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0812984250&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A25Z&v=2&sig=9a9sG9Q9DvLiOxy%252FKPa2C2TQPoAWlz5i6anVxQNNnbo%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST • NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW</i></b><br><br><b><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY</b><br> <b><i>People • The New York Times Magazine • </i>NPR • <i>Entertainment Weekly • New York • The Telegraph • BuzzFeed • Kirkus Reviews • BookPage • Shelf Awareness</i></b><br><br>Includes an extended conversation with David Sedaris</b><br><br>One of the most important and blazingly original writers of his generation, George Saunders is an undisputed master of the short story, and <i>Tenth of December</i> is his most honest, accessible, and moving collection yet.<br>  <br> In the taut opener, “Victory Lap,” a boy witnesses the attempted abduction of the girl next door and is faced with a harrowing choice: Does he ignore what he sees, or override years of smothering advice from his parents and act? In “Home,” a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antiques store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of <i>Tenth of December</i> are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders’s signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.<br>  <br> Writing brilliantly and profoundly about class, sex, love, loss, work, despair, and war, Saunders cuts to the core of the contemporary experience. These stories take on the big questions and explore the fault lines of our own morality, delving into the questions of what makes us good and what makes us human.<br>  <br> Unsettling, insightful, and hilarious, the stories in <i>Tenth of December</i>—through their manic energy, their focus on what is redeemable in human beings, and their generosity of spirit—not only entertain and delight; they fulfill Chekhov’s dictum that art should “prepare us for tenderness.”<br><br><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<br></b><br>“The best book you’ll read this year.”<b>—<i>The New York Times Magazine</i></b><br> <b><i> </i></b><br> “A feat of inventiveness . . .

In “Home,” a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antiques store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of <i>Tenth of December</i> are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders’s signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.<br>  <br> Writing brilliantly and profoundly about class, sex, love, loss, work, despair, and war, Saunders cuts to the core of the contemporary experience. These stories take on the big questions and explore the fault lines of our own morality, delving into the questions of what makes us good and what makes us human.<br>  <br> Unsettling, insightful, and hilarious, the stories in <i>Tenth of December</i>—through their manic energy, their focus on what is redeemable in human beings, and their generosity of spirit—not only entertain and delight; they fulfill Chekhov’s dictum that art should “prepare us for tenderness.”<br><br><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<br></b><br>“The best book you’ll read this year.”<b>—<i>The New York Times Magazine</i></b><br> <b><i> </i></b><br> “A feat of inventiveness . . .

Saunders' wonderful ability to portray a character's inner monologue--the secret voices, the little fantasies, the inside jokes, the spots of sadness--might be his greatest talent as a writer. But he is also expert at parceling out details to hook the reader and nudge the story in whatever direction he wants it to go. While these stories are generally more straightforward than we’re used to seeing from this author, the turns they take are constantly surprising. Saunders is an American original, a writer gifted at expressing the irony and absurdity all around us and inside us, but his ultimate goal is to show us something deeper: Our lives are composed of genuine experiences that deserve to be taken seriously. --<i>Chris Schluep</i>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Satire","id":"4477"},{"name":"Anthologies","id":"10303"},{"name":"Short Stories","id":"10307"},{"name":"United States","id":"9822"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"}],"attributes":{"Author":"George Saunders","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Random House","EAN":"9780812993806","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780812993806"},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Unsettling, insightful, and hilarious, the stories in Tenth of December-through their manic energy, their focus on what is redeemable in human beings, and their generosity of spirit-not only entertain and delight; they fulfill Chekhov's dictum that art should \"prepare us for tenderness.\"","Format":"Deckle Edge","ISBN":"0812993806","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"590","Weight":"100","Width":"100"},"Label":"Random House","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$26.00"},"Manufacturer":"Random House","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"272","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"120","Length":"840","Weight":"95","Width":"580"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2013-01-08","Publisher":"Random House","ReleaseDate":"2013-01-08","Studio":"Random House","Title":"Tenth of December: Stories"}}}},{"id":"0805080686","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1700,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.00"},"asin":"0805080686","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Wolf-Hall-Hilary-Mantel/dp/0805080686?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0805080686","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Wolf-Hall-Hilary-Mantel/dp/0805080686?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0805080686","salesRank":63076,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dk%2BYc-faL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dk%2BYc-faL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"Wolf Hall","similar":["0805090037","0802123171","125002417X","1400030552","B00T797AT4","0307700879","0316074314","0374260508","159448600X","1524759619"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0805080686&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A27Z&v=2&sig=IRZLQtuDk9cox4EAyHxUwE9oKpkL1K8Pyp%252BrT2Ir3j0%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><b>In the ruthless arena of King Henry VIII's court, only one man dares to gamble his life to win the king's favor and ascend to the heights of political power</b></p><p>England in the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. The quest for the king's freedom destroys his adviser, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum. </p><p>Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell is a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people and a demon of energy: he is also a consummate politician, hardened by his personal losses, implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph? </p><p>In inimitable style, Hilary Mantel presents a picture of a half-made society on the cusp of change, where individuals fight or embrace their fate with passion and courage. With a vast array of characters, overflowing with incident, the novel re-creates an era when the personal and political are separated by a hairbreadth, where success brings unlimited power but a single failure means death.</p>"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<strong>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:</strong> No character in the canon has been writ larger than Henry VIII, but that didn't stop Hilary Mantel. She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy of <em>Wolf Hall</em> along. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Biographical","id":"9332127011"},{"name":"Renaissance","id":"10240"},{"name":"World Literature","id":"10311"},{"name":"United States","id":"9822"},{"name":"Contemporary","id":"10129"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"},{"name":"Family Activities","id":"11365"},{"name":"Devotionals","id":"69980"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Hilary Mantel","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Henry Holt Company","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["XM-0805080686","POXM-0805080686"]},"EAN":"9780805080681","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780805080681"},"Edition":"First","Feature":"In the ruthless arena of King Henry VIII's court, only one man dares to gamble his life to win the king's favor and ascend to the heights of political power","ISBN":"0805080686","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"950","Length":"652","Weight":"100","Width":"178"},"Label":"Henry Holt and Co.","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3500","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$35.00"},"Manufacturer":"Henry Holt and Co.","MPN":"9780805080681","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"560","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"200","Length":"940","Weight":"180","Width":"620"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780805080681","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2009-10-13","Publisher":"Henry Holt and Co.","ReleaseDate":"2009-10-13","Studio":"Henry Holt and Co.","Title":"Wolf Hall"}}}},{"id":"0316316121","data":{"width":51.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1768,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.68"},"asin":"0316316121","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Less-Winner-Pulitzer-Prize-Novel/dp/0316316121?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316316121","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Less-Winner-Pulitzer-Prize-Novel/dp/0316316121?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316316121","salesRank":5211,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MV%2BfoRGbL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"103"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MV%2BfoRGbL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"322"},"title":"Less (Winner of the Pulitzer Prize): A Novel","similar":["1455563935","0525521194","0735220689","0316392383","0525520376","0525521224","0399590501","1476716730","0735211027","0812995341"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0316316121&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A27Z&v=2&sig=TOtGdtPqaS5hfMRHOPPlDBg4f03EOFf4TxJ9WoidKNY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><b>A struggling novelist travels the world to avoid an awkward wedding in this hilarious Pulitzer Prize-winning novel full of \"arresting lyricism and beauty\" (<em>The </em><i>New York Times Book Review).</i></b></b><b><b><i></i></b></b></br></br><strong >WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE<br></strong><strong >National Bestseller<br></strong><strong >A<i> New York Times</i> Notable Book of 2017<br></strong><b >A <i>Washington Post </i>Top Ten Book of 2017<br></b><b >A <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> Top Ten Book of 2017<br></b><b ><b><b><b>Longlisted for the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence, the Lambda Award, and the California Book Award</b></b></b></b></br></br><b><i></i></b><i></i></br></br>Who says you can't run away from your problems?

But soon bullets begin to fly, fighter jets streak the sky, and curfews fall. As the spell of violence spreads, they flee their country, leaving behind their loved ones. Early in <em>Exit West</em>, the author Mohsin Hamid explains that geography is destiny, and in the case of his two young lovers, geography dictates that they must leave. Hamid offers up a fantastical device to deliver his refugees to places: they pass through magic doors. Rather than unmooring the story from reality, this device, as well as a few other fantastical touches, makes the book more poignant and focused, pointing our attention to the emotions of exile rather than the mechanics. Surrounded by other refugees, Nadia and Saeed try to establish their places in the world, putting up different responses to their circumstances. The result is a novel that is personal, not pedantic, an intimate human story about an experience shared by countless people of the world, one that most Americans just witness on television. --<em>Chris Schluep , The Amazon Book Review </em></p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Cultural Heritage","id":"8946929011"},{"name":"Political","id":"171129"},{"name":"United States","id":"9822"},{"name":"Literary","id":"10132"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Mohsin Hamid","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"RIVERHEAD","EAN":"9780735212176","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780735212176"},"Edition":"First Edition","Feature":"RIVERHEAD","ISBN":"0735212171","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"856","Length":"575","Weight":"130","Width":"84"},"Label":"Riverhead Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$26.00"},"Manufacturer":"Riverhead Books","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"240","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"830","Weight":"130","Width":"580"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-03-07","Publisher":"Riverhead Books","ReleaseDate":"2017-03-07","Studio":"Riverhead Books","Title":"Exit West: A Novel"}}}},{"id":"0399583610","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1406,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.06"},"asin":"0399583610","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solution-Why-Your-Broken/dp/0399583610?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0399583610","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solution-Why-Your-Broken/dp/0399583610?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0399583610","salesRank":39389,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lU7%2BHlGaL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lU7%2BHlGaL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep is Broken and How to Fix It","similar":["1501144324","1976792649","110190402X","1626253439","1936303728","1501144316","0805089586","1499250533","0738234621","1623367395"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0399583610&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A27Z&v=2&sig=vzlZ6GWApMhnVbqVK14snhT%252F1vJ7TfFUmX4eH8UIZ1M%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>With cutting-edge sleep science and time-tested techniques, <i>The Sleep Solution</i> will help anyone achieve healthy sleep and eliminate pills, pain, and fatigue.</b><br> <b> </b><br> If you want to fix your sleep problems, Internet tips and tricks aren’t going to do it for you.

In the past forty years, scientists have discovered that our sleep (or lack of it) can affect nearly every aspect of our waking lives. Poor sleep could be a sign of a disease, the result of a vitamin or iron deficiency, or the cause of numerous other problems, both sleeping and waking. Yet many people, even medical personnel, are unaware of the dangers of poor sleep.

Ten years ago, Michael Pollan confronted us with this seemingly simple question and, with <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma, </i>his brilliant and eye-opening exploration of our food choices, demonstrated that how we answer it today may determine not only our health but our survival as a species. In the years since, Pollan’s revolutionary examination has changed the way Americans think about food. Bringing wide attention to the little-known but vitally important dimensions of food and agriculture in America, Pollan launched a national conversation about what we eat and the profound consequences that even the simplest everyday food choices have on both ourselves and the natural world. Ten years later, <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</i> continues to transform the way Americans think about the politics, perils, and pleasures of eating."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"History","id":"4232"},{"name":"Paleo","id":"7114436011"},{"name":"Vegan","id":"7661761011"},{"name":"Vegetarian","id":"6511974011"},{"name":"Nutrition","id":"282861"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"},{"name":"Popular Culture","id":"4556"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Michael Pollan","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Michael Pollan","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["POXM-0143038583","XM-0143038583"]},"EAN":"9780143038580","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780143038580","8601416903538"]},"Feature":"The Omnivore s Dilemma A Natural History of Four Meals","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0143038583","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"839","Length":"548","Weight":"95","Width":"98"},"Label":"Penguin","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$18.00"},"Manufacturer":"Penguin","MPN":"22540405","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"450","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"157","Length":"843","Weight":"89","Width":"555"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"22540405","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2007-08-28","Publisher":"Penguin","ReleaseDate":"2007-08-28","Studio":"Penguin","Title":"The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals"}}}},{"id":"0143114743","data":{"width":51.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1445,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.45"},"asin":"0143114743","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Place-My-Own-Architecture-Daydreams/dp/0143114743?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143114743","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Place-My-Own-Architecture-Daydreams/dp/0143114743?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143114743","salesRank":25291,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UiGv9POdL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"103"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UiGv9POdL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"322"},"title":"A Place of My Own: The Architecture of Daydreams","similar":["0802140114","1594204225","0375760393","0292716362","0143125338","014311638X","0143114964","0143038583","0765300133","1594203083"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0143114743&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A29Z&v=2&sig=j7EUOalI9RSFfEjVts6pVBdx2F3%252Fig25DzReAAXFqew%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>A captivating personal inquiry into the art of architecture, the craft of building, and the meaning of modern work</b><br><br> <i>“A room of one’s own: Is there anybody who hasn’t at one time or another wished for such a place, hasn’t turned those soft words over until they’d assumed a habitable shape?”</i><br><br> When Michael Pollan decided to plant a garden, the result was the acclaimed bestseller <i>Second Nature</i>.

That moment was the culmination of Vladimir Putin’s long mission to undermine Western democracy, a mission that he and his hand-selected group of oligarchs and Mafia kingpins had ensnared Trump in, starting more than twenty years ago with the massive bailout of a string of sensational Trump hotel and casino failures in Atlantic City. This book confirms the most incredible American paranoias about Russian malevolence. <br><br>To most, it will be a hair-raising revelation that the Cold War did not end in 1991—that it merely evolved, with Trump’s apartments offering the perfect vehicle for billions of dollars to leave the collapsing Soviet Union. In <i>House of Trump, House of Putin</i>, Craig Unger methodically traces the deep-rooted alliance between the highest echelons of American political operatives and the biggest players in the frightening underworld of the Russian Mafia. He traces Donald Trump’s sordid ascent from foundering real estate tycoon to leader of the free world. He traces Russia’s phoenixlike rise from the ashes of the post–Cold War Soviet Union as well as its ceaseless covert efforts to retaliate against the West and reclaim its status as a global superpower. <br><br>Without Trump, Russia would have lacked a key component in its attempts to return to imperial greatness. Without Russia, Trump would not be president.

It will show how Russia and its fifth column allies tried to flip the cornerstones of democracy in order to re-engineer the world political order that has kept most of the world free since 1945. <br><br>Career U.S. Intelligence officer Malcolm Nance will examine how Russia has used cyber warfare, political propaganda, and manipulation of our perception of reality--and will do so again--to weaponize American news, traditional media, social media, and the workings of the internet to attack and break apart democratic institutions from within, and what we can expect to come should we fail to stop their next attack.<br><br>Nance has utilized top secret Russian-sourced political and hybrid warfare strategy documents to demonstrate the master plan to undermine American institutions that has been in effect from the Cold War to the present day. Based on original research and countless interviews with espionage experts, Nance examines how Putin's recent hacking accomplished a crucial first step for destabilizing the West for Russia, and why Putin is just the man to do it. <br><br>Nance exposes how Russia has supported the campaigns of right-wing extremists throughout both the U.S. and Europe to leverage an axis of autocracy, and how Putin's agencies have worked since 2010 to bring fringe candidate Donald Trump into elections.<br><br>Revelatory, insightful, and shocking, <i>The Plot To Destroy Democracy</i> puts a professional spy lens on Putin's plot and unravels it play-by-play. In the end, he provides a better understanding of why Putin's efforts are a serious threat to our national security and global alliances--in much more than one election--and a blistering indictment of Putin's puppet, President Donald J. Trump.<br>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"United States","id":"4853"},{"name":"Democracy","id":"10761"},{"name":"Fascism","id":"16022901"},{"name":"European","id":"5571271011"},{"name":"Russian & Former Soviet Union","id":"5571273011"},{"name":"History & Theory","id":"11086"},{"name":"Elections","id":"16023061"},{"name":"Intelligence & Espionage","id":"3049221"},{"name":"National & International Security","id":"3049231"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Malcolm Nance","Binding":"Hardcover","Creator":"Rob Reiner","EAN":"9780316484817","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780316484817"},"ISBN":"0316484814","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"938","Length":"638","Weight":"119","Width":"125"},"Label":"Hachette Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Hachette Books","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"352","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"900","Weight":"110","Width":"590"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-06-26","Publisher":"Hachette Books","ReleaseDate":"2018-06-26","Studio":"Hachette Books","Title":"The Plot to Destroy Democracy: How Putin and His Spies Are Undermining America and Dismantling the West"}}}},{"id":"125030119X","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2700,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$27.00"},"asin":"125030119X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-President-Truth-About-Pence/dp/125030119X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=125030119X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-President-Truth-About-Pence/dp/125030119X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=125030119X","salesRank":25684,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lqL4ZP-oL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lqL4ZP-oL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence","similar":["1501175513","198210970X","0062803700","1982103124","0062690779","0316484814","0544716248","0451497899","0525574824","0525558640"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=125030119X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A31Z&v=2&sig=pzhirvJkEtOtHUgpumxUxbbzNEaBJw%252BurtFLEgKV6G8%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><b>\"It presents an entirely damning portrait of Pence.

Behind his self-proclaimed humility and self-abasing deference, however, hides a man whose own presidential ambitions have blazed since high school. Pence’s drive for power, perhaps inspired by his belief that God might have big plans for him, explains why he shocked his allies by lending Christian credibility to a scandal-plagued candidate like Trump.</p><p>In this landmark biography, Pulitzer Prize-winner Michael D’Antonio and Emmy-nominated journalist Peter Eisner follow the path Pence followed from Catholic Democrat to conservative evangelical Republican. They reveal how he used his time as rightwing radio star to build connections with powerful donors; how he was a lackluster lawmaker in Congress but a prodigious fundraiser from the GOP’s billionaire benefactors; and how, once he locked in his views on the issues―anti-gay, pro-gun, anti-abortion, pro big-business―he became laser-focused on his own pursuit of power.</p><p>As <b>THE SHADOW PRESIDENT</b> reveals, Mike Pence is the most important and powerful Christian Right politician America has ever seen. Driven as much by theology as personal ambition, Pence is now positioned to seize the big prize―the presidency―and use it to fashion a nation more pleasing to his god and corporate sponsors.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Political","id":"2397"},{"name":"Presidents & Heads of State","id":"2418"},{"name":"State & Local","id":"14278871"},{"name":"National","id":"720030"},{"name":"Executive Branch","id":"16023131"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Michael D'Antonio","Peter Eisner"],"Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781250301192","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781250301192"},"ISBN":"125030119X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"955","Length":"650","Width":"100"},"Label":"Thomas Dunne Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2899","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.99"},"Manufacturer":"Thomas Dunne Books","NumberOfPages":"320","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"955","Weight":"115","Width":"650"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-08-28","Publisher":"Thomas Dunne Books","ReleaseDate":"2018-08-28","Studio":"Thomas Dunne Books","Title":"The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence"}}}},{"id":"0399589813","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1717,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.17"},"asin":"0399589813","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Soul-America-Battle-Better-Angels/dp/0399589813?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0399589813","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Soul-America-Battle-Better-Angels/dp/0399589813?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0399589813","salesRank":216,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XQBdiakFL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XQBdiakFL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"330"},"title":"The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels","similar":["0812976665","0062802186","1476795924","0735216134","0316484814","0525558640","1501175513","0812983203","1982103124","0062437216"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0399589813&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A31Z&v=2&sig=v2fUygKfz6p3Nfcpv4WnVDTMYQM5z%252FdHlfyjP%252FOrck8%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER • Pulitzer Prize–winning author Jon Meacham helps us understand the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in our history when hope overcame division and fear.</b><br><br> Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in <i>The Soul of America</i> Meacham shows us how what Abraham Lincoln called the “better angels of our nature” have repeatedly won the day. Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women’s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson’s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear—a struggle that continues even now.<br><br>While the American story has not always—or even often—been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us, “The good news is that we have come through such darkness before”—as, time and again, Lincoln’s better angels have found a way to prevail.<br><b><br>Praise for <i>The Soul of America</i></b><br><br>“Appalled by the ascendancy of Donald J. Trump, and shaken by the deadly white nationalist rallies in Charlottesville in 2017, Meacham returns to other moments in our history when fear and division seemed rampant. He wants to remind us that the current political turmoil is not unprecedented, that as a nation we have survived times worse than this. . . . Meacham tries to summon the better angels by looking back at when America truly has been great. He is effective as ever at writing history for a broad readership.”<b>—<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>“This is a brilliant, fascinating, timely, and above all profoundly important book.”<b>—Walter Isaacson</b>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Immigrants","id":"6343225011"},{"name":"Historical Study & Educational Resources","id":"4987"},{"name":"Civil Rights & Liberties","id":"10550"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jon Meacham","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780399589812","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780399589812"},"Edition":"1st","ISBN":"0399589813","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"949","Length":"634","Weight":"156","Width":"127"},"Label":"Random House","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Random House","MPN":"51119974","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"416","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"190","Length":"930","Weight":"165","Width":"610"},"PartNumber":"51119974","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-05-08","Publisher":"Random House","ReleaseDate":"2018-05-08","Studio":"Random House","Title":"The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels"}}}},{"id":"0520265866","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2245,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$22.45"},"asin":"0520265866","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Constant-Fire-Beyond-Science-Religion/dp/0520265866?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0520265866","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Constant-Fire-Beyond-Science-Religion/dp/0520265866?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0520265866","salesRank":817274,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IGKpMigxL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IGKpMigxL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"328"},"title":"The Constant Fire: Beyond the Science vs. Religion Debate","similar":["0393609014","0199295514","0520261879","1416542744","1439169608","1594204225","0691157243","1501144316","0307455777","0882143530"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0520265866&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A31Z&v=2&sig=gfoXW0CNYDb3s2GDt905iU7eg0JBJrse4qDiaHMyaQ8%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<DIV>Eloquent, urgent, and inspiring, <I>The Constant Fire</I> tackles the acrimonious debate between science and religion, taking us beyond its stagnant parameters into the wider domain of human spiritual experience.

What does it mean for time to \"flow\"? Do we exist in time or does time exist in us? In lyric, accessible prose, Carlo Rovelli invites us to consider questions about the nature of time that continue to puzzle physicists and philosophers alike.<br><br>For most readers this is unfamiliar terrain. We all experience time, but the more scientists learn about it, the more mysterious it remains. We think of it as uniform and universal, moving steadily from past to future, measured by clocks. Rovelli tears down these assumptions one by one, revealing a strange universe where at the most fundamental level time disappears. He explains how the theory of quantum gravity attempts to understand and give meaning to the resulting extreme landscape of this timeless world. Weaving together ideas from philosophy, science and literature, he suggests that our perception of the flow of time depends on our perspective, better understood starting from the structure of our brain and emotions than from the physical universe.<br><br>Already a bestseller in Italy, and written with the poetic vitality that made <i>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</i> so appealing, <i>The Order of Time</i> offers a profoundly intelligent, culturally rich, novel appreciation of the mysteries of time."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Cosmology","id":"13449"},{"name":"Relativity","id":"14592"},{"name":"Time","id":"14598"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Carlo Rovelli","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780735216105","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780735216105"},"Edition":"1st Edition","ISBN":"073521610X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"760","Length":"510","Weight":"64","Width":"80"},"Label":"Riverhead Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$20.00"},"Manufacturer":"Riverhead Books","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"256","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"740","Weight":"66","Width":"510"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-05-08","Publisher":"Riverhead Books","ReleaseDate":"2018-05-08","Studio":"Riverhead Books","Title":"The Order of Time"}}}},{"id":"0735224560","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1703,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.03"},"asin":"0735224560","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Spying-Whales-Present-Awesome-Creatures/dp/0735224560?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735224560","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Spying-Whales-Present-Awesome-Creatures/dp/0735224560?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735224560","salesRank":3899,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CJ0Kaa4mL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CJ0Kaa4mL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"Spying on Whales: The Past, Present, and Future of Earth's Most Awesome Creatures","similar":["0062490427","0465052614","160358739X","0190673095","0399576428","1476776628","0525557318","0375411410","0393248852","110198161X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0735224560&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-08-19T05%3A19%3A31Z&v=2&sig=hiTBe41KXa%252FjHO2tTOEajQKULbw9A33ZLnSoYfM887Y%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>A dive into the secret lives of whales, from their evolutionary past to today's cutting edge of science</b><br><br>Whales are among the largest, most intelligent, deepest diving species to have ever lived on our planet.

Whales fill us with terror, awe, and affection--yet there is still so much we don't know about them. Why did it take whales over 50 million years to evolve to such big sizes, and how do they eat enough to stay that big? How did their ancestors return from land to the sea--and what can their lives tell us about evolution as a whole? Importantly, in the sweepstakes of human-driven habitat and climate change, will whales survive?<br><br>Nick Pyenson's research has given us the answers to some of our biggest questions about whales.

In the meantime, Israel has subjected Gaza to a merciless illegal blockade.<BR />  <BR /> What has befallen Gaza is a man-made humanitarian disaster.<BR />  <BR /> Based on scores of human rights reports, Norman G. Finkelstein's new book presents a meticulously researched inquest into Gaza’s martyrdom.

One of his most disturbing conclusions is that, after Judge Richard Goldstone's humiliating retraction of his UN report, human rights organizations succumbed to the Israeli juggernaut.<BR /><BR />
