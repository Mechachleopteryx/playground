<h5>Personal Opinion</h5>
<p>
  I picked this book mostly out of curiosity. I'm not a marketing person. But after I finished reading the book,
  I started seeing good marketing.
</p>
<p>
  I also see many bad marketing (or marketing that is not appealing to me).
  For example, so many websites are bagging to give them your e-mail address. Sigh.
</p>
<p>What is peculiar about this grpah, is that huge portion of it occupied by social media.</p>
<p>Allan specifically called out that social media is not the only way to do marketing. I guess
  the subject is still very hot in minds of marketing books buyers.
