What if you could test your business model earlier in the process—before you’ve expended valuable time and resources? </b><br> <br>You’ve talked to customers. You’ve identified problems that need solving, and maybe even built a minimum viable product. But now there’s a second bridge to cross. How do you tell whether your idea represents a viable business? Do you really have to go through the whole cycle of development, failure, iteration, tweak, repeat? <br><i> </i><br><i>Scaling Lean </i>offers an invaluable blueprint for mod­eling startup success. You’ll learn the essential metrics that measure the output of a working business model, give you the pulse of your company, communicate its health to investors, and enable you to make precise interventions when things go wrong. You’ll also learn how to: <br> <br>· ballpark the viability of a business model using a simple five-minute back-of-the-envelope estimation. <br>· stop using current revenue as a measure of progress (it forces you to fly blind and, often, to overpromise to your shareholders) and instead embrace the met­ric of traction—which helps you identify the leading indicators for future business model growth. <br>· set progressive goals that set you up for exponen­tial long-term success by implementing a staged 10X rollout strategy, like one employed by Face­book and Tesla. <br>· stop burying your breakthrough insights in failed experiments, but rather illuminate them using two-week LEAN sprints to quickly source, rank, and test ideas. <br> <br>Ash Maurya, a serial entrepreneur and author of the startup cult classic <i>Running Lean</i>, pairs real-world examples of startups like Airbnb and Hubspot with techniques from the manufacturing world in this tacti­cal handbook for scaling with maximum efficiency and efficacy.

Fresh content matters here, and the faster you can get your photos up, the more likely they will be shared.</li> <li><b>Monitor search keywords.</b><br/> What keywords are people using to find your blog or website? Those keywords can inform your content stories and suggest new opportunities based on what customers are already interested in.</li> <li><b>Trawl industry news.</b><br/> Share an opinion about a recent news story that's affecting your industry or audience. Be timely; you could benefit from the extra boost of being one of the first to comment on the topic.</li> <li><b>Go behind the scenes.</b><br/> Show things that your readers or followers don't usually get to see. Share photos that give an insider's view of your company, or tease some new, compelling content, product or event that you'll be launching soon.</li> <li><b>Go to an event.</b><br/> Take session notes, conduct interviews, or take photos. Real-time blog or tweet the sessions that offer value to your community, and share with your audience what you learned, enjoyed, or were surprised at.</li> <li><b>Share best practices or productivity tips.</b> <br/> People are always looking for efficiencies, and this type of content is always highly useful and shareable. </li> <li><b>Invite guest posts.</b><br/> Give your readers or employees or an expert in the industry the chance to guest post for your blog. Don't limit yourself to written content.</li> <li><b>Create a regular content series.</b><br/> A themed series is a great way to help you create regular content.

The Customer Success philosophy is invading the boardroom and impacting the way CEOs think about their business. Today, Customer Success is the hottest B2B movement since the advent of the subscription business model, and this book is the one-of-a-kind guide that shows you how to make it work in your company.<br /><br /> From the initial planning stages through execution, you'll have expert guidance to help you:<br /><ul><li>Understand the context that led to the start of the Customer Success movement</li><li>Build a Customer Success strategy proven by the most competitive companies in the world</li><li>Implement an action plan for structuring the Customer Success organization, tiering your customers, and developing the right cross-functional playbooks</li></ul>Customers want products that help them achieve their own business outcomes.

Based on the industry's leading certification from the Digital Marketing Institute (DMI), this book presents an innovative methodology for successful digital marketing: start with the customer and work backwards. A campaign is only effective as it is reflective of the consumer's wants, needs, preferences, and inclinations; the DMI framework provides structured, implementable, iterative direction for getting it right every time. The heart of the framework is a three-step process called the 3i Principles: Initiate, Iterate, and Integrate. This simple idea translates into higher engagement, real customer interaction, and multichannel campaigns that extend even into traditional marketing channels.</p><p>The evolution of digital marketing isn't really about the brands; it's about consumers exercising more control over their choices.

This thoroughly updated second edition shares the same objective of being the most valuable resource for technology product managers, yet it is completely new—sharing the latest practices and techniques of today’s most-successful tech product companies, and the men and women behind every great product.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Education & Reference","id":"2732"},{"name":"New Business Enterprises","id":"2751"},{"name":"Customer Relations","id":"2635"},{"name":"Research & Development","id":"10020723011"},{"name":"Products","id":"7921653011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Marty Cagan","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Unknown","EAN":"9781119387503","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781119387503"},"Edition":"2","ISBN":"1119387507","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"910","Length":"650","Width":"150"},"Label":"Wiley","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Wiley","MPN":"26614609","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"368","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"150","Length":"950","Weight":"125","Width":"600"},"PartNumber":"26614609","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-12-04","Publisher":"Wiley","Studio":"Wiley","Title":"INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love"}}}},{"id":"1119418070","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1830,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$18.30"},"asin":"1119418070","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Phone-Scripts-Word-Word/dp/1119418070?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1119418070","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Phone-Scripts-Word-Word/dp/1119418070?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1119418070","salesRank":49534,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CPw3Ib-VL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CPw3Ib-VL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"Power Phone Scripts: 500 Word-for-Word Questions, Phrases, and Conversations to Open and Close More Sales","similar":["1935602055","1119477387","1119144752","1118588711","0998684813","0735211698","1119312574","1973470756","0814437761","0814431771"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1119418070&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A04Z&v=2&sig=U2PJtmmhJ4avig7ok48bPam6%252FpBngFfm4Crko3s%252F2rw%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><b>Start closing sales like top producers!</b></p><p>Have you ever found yourself at a loss for what to say when the gatekeeper asks you what your call is about? Have your palms ever sweated when the decision maker shuts you down with: “I wouldn’t be interested”? Has your heart taken a fast dive into your stomach when, at the start of your presentation, your prospect tells you that they’ve thought about it and are just going to pass?</p><p>If you’re in sales, then the question isn’t “Have you ever felt this way?”, but rather, “How often do you feel this way? Are you finally ready to learn how to confidently and effectively overcome these objections, stalls, and blow-offs? If so, <i>Power Phone Scripts</i> was written for you! Unlike other books on sales that tell you what you should do (like build value – hard to do when the prospect is hanging up on you!), <i>Power Phone Scripts</i> provides word-for-word scripts, phrases, questions, and comebacks that you can use on your very next call. Learn to overcome resistance, get through to the decision maker, and then, once you have him or her on the phone, make an instant connection and earn the right to have a meaningful conversation. You’ll be equipped with proven questions, conversation starters, and techniques to learn whether or not they are even right for your product or service, and, if they aren’t, who else in their company or another department might be.</p><p><i>Power Phone Scripts</i> is the sales manual you’ve been looking for: over 500 proven, current, and non-salesy phrases, rebuttals, questions, and conversation openers that will instantly make you sound more confident – just like the top producing sales pros do right now. Gone will be your call reluctance; gone will be your fear of calling prospects back for presentations and demos; gone will be the fear of asking for the sale at the end of your pitch! This practical guide is filled with effective scripts for prospecting, emailing, voice mails, closes, and tons of rebuttals to recurring objections you get like:</p><ul><li>“It costs too much”</li><li>“We already have a vendor for that”</li><li>“I’m going to need to think about it”</li><li>“I need to talk to the boss or committee” and so many others…</li></ul><p>More than just phone scripts, this book provides practical, comprehensive guidance that every inside sales rep needs. Conquer concerns, provide answers, motivate action, and be the conduit between your prospect’s problems and your solution. Actionable, fun, and designed to work within the current sales environment, this invaluable guide is your ticket to the top of the leader board. With <i>Power Phone Scripts</i>, you will never be at a loss of what to say to a prospect or client.</p><p>Communication is everything in sales, and being on top of your game is no longer enough when top producers are playing a different game altogether. You cannot achieve winning stats if you're not even on the field. If you're ready to join the big league, <i>Power Phone Scripts</i> is the playbook you need to win at inside sales.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Sales & Selling","id":"2712"},{"name":"Communications","id":"2560"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Mike Brooks","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9781119418078","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781119418078"},"Edition":"1","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1119418070","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"910","Length":"590","Weight":"115","Width":"130"},"Label":"Wiley","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Wiley","NumberOfPages":"304","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"909","Weight":"115","Width":"598"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-06-26","Publisher":"Wiley","Studio":"Wiley","Title":"Power Phone Scripts: 500 Word-for-Word Questions, Phrases, and Conversations to Open and Close More Sales"}}}},{"id":"1119439817","data":{"width":64,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1637,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.37"},"asin":"1119439817","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Instagram-Business-Dummies-Jennifer-Herman/dp/1119439817?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1119439817","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Instagram-Business-Dummies-Jennifer-Herman/dp/1119439817?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1119439817","salesRank":21686,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YP2EKZh5L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"128"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YP2EKZh5L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"399"},"title":"Instagram For Business For Dummies","similar":["0692873953","1119476216","1118954831","1119453860","1983805912","1250182212","1119330394","1599186020","1118816188","1973401762"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1119439817&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A02Z&v=2&sig=w0fJ9TWvHPPwFMcUa2zG3IIVOQKYRb2sOi15rsWG62o%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>Leverage the power of Instagram to promote your brand</b><p>Instagram is the photo- and video-sharing app used by millions across the globe.

Context matters. Complex sales are different from one-call closes. B2B is different than B2C. Prospects, territories, products, industries, companies, and sales processes are all different. There is little black and white in the sales profession.</p><p>Except for <i>objections</i>. There is democracy in objections. Every salesperson must endure many NOs in order to get to YES. </p><p>Objections don’t care or consider:</p><ul><li>Who you are</li><li>What you sell</li><li>How you sell</li><li>If you are new to sales or a veteran</li><li>If your sales cycle is long or short – complex or transactional</li></ul><p>For as long as salespeople have been asking buyers to make commitments, buyers have been throwing out objections.

Then he pulls you in with examples, stories, and lessons that teach powerful human-influence frameworks for getting past NO - even with the most challenging objections.</p><p>What you won’t find, though, is old school techniques straight out of the last century. No bait and switch schemes, no sycophantic tie-downs, no cheesy scripts, and none of the contrived closing techniques that leave you feeling like a phony, destroy relationships, and only serve to increase your buyers’ resistance.</p><p>Instead, you’ll learn a new psychology for turning-around objections and proven techniques that work with today’s more informed, in control, and skeptical buyers. Inside the pages of <i>Objections</i>, you’ll gain deep insight into:</p><ul><li>How to get past the natural human fear of NO and become rejection proof</li><li>The science of resistance and why buyers throw out objections</li><li>Human influence frameworks that turn you into a master persuader</li><li>The key to avoiding embarrassing red herrings that derail sales calls</li><li>How to leverage the “Magical Quarter of a Second” to instantly gain control of your emotions when you get hit with difficult objections</li><li>Proven objection turn-around frameworks that give you confidence and control in virtually every sales situation</li><li>How to easily skip past reflex responses on cold calls and when prospecting</li><li>How to move past brush-offs to get to the next step, increase pipeline velocity, and shorten the sales cycle</li><li>The 5 Step Process for Turning Around Buying Commitment Objections and closing the sale</li><li>Rapid Negotiation techniques that deliver better terms and higher prices</li></ul><p>As you dive into these powerful insights, and with each new chapter, you’ll gain greater and greater confidence in your ability to face and effectively handle objections in any selling situation.

From iconic entrepreneurs to elite athletes, from artists to billionaire investors, their short profiles can help you answer life's most challenging questions, achieve extraordinary results, and transform your life.</B><BR /><BR /><B>From the author:</B><BR /><BR /> In 2017, several of my close friends died in rapid succession. It was a very hard year, as it was for many people.<BR /><BR /> It was also a stark reminder that time is our scarcest, non-renewable resource.<BR /><BR /> With a renewed sense of urgency, I began asking myself many questions:<BR /><BR /> Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want?<BR /> How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning?<BR /> How could I be kinder to myself?<BR /> How could I better say “no” to the trivial many to better say “yes” to the critical few?<BR /> How could I best reassess my priorities and my purpose in this world?<BR /><BR /> To find answers, I reached out to the most impressive world-class performers in the world, ranging from wunderkinds in their 20s to icons in their 70s and 80s. No stone was left unturned.<BR /><BR /> This book contains their answers—practical and tactical advice from mentors who have found solutions. Whether you want to 10x your results, get unstuck, or reinvent yourself, someone else has traveled a similar path and taken notes.<BR /><BR /> This book, <I>Tribe of Mentors</I>, includes many of the people I grew up viewing as idols or demi-gods. Less than 10% have been on my podcast (<I>The Tim Ferriss Show</I>, more than 200 million downloads), making this a brand-new playbook of playbooks.<BR /><BR /> No matter your challenge or opportunity, something in these pages can help.<BR /><BR /> Among other things, you will learn:<BR /><BR /> • More than 50 morning routines—both for the early riser and those who struggle to get out of bed.<BR /> • How TED curator Chris Anderson realized that the best way to get things done is to let go.<BR /> • The best purchases of $100 or less (you'll never have to think about the right gift again).<BR /> • How to overcome failure and bounce back towards success.<BR /> • Why Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton believes that the best art will always be the riskiest.<BR /> • How to meditate and be more mindful (and not just for those that find it easy).<BR /> • Why tennis champion Maria Sharapova believe that “losing makes you think in ways victories can’t.”<BR /> • How to truly achieve work-life balance (and why most people tell you it isn’t realistic).<BR /> • How billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz transformed the way he engages with difficult situations to reduce suffering.<BR /> • Ways to thrive (and survive) the overwhelming amount of information you process every day.<BR /> • How to achieve clarity on your purpose and assess your priorities.<BR /> • And much more.<BR /><BR /> This reference book, which I wrote for myself, has already changed my life. I certainly hope the same for you.<BR /><BR /> I wish you luck as you forge your own path.<BR /><BR /> All the best,<BR /><BR /> Tim Ferriss</DIV>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Motivational","id":"4744"},{"name":"Success","id":"4749"},{"name":"Motivation &

It’s organized according to the design of the first-year marketing course in Harvard Business School’s MBA program. Each chapter was written by HBS faculty and used by MBA students to analyze marketing opportunities and develop and execute successful marketing strategies. Areas covered include:</ul><li>Consumer behavior<li>Business-to-business markets<li>The four P’s-product, placement, promotion and price<li>Market segmentation, target market selection, and positioning<li>Unique value propositions<li>The design of new products and services<li>Product line extensions and repositioning of exciting businesses<li>Brand valuation and brand equity<li>Fulfillment and after-sale service<li>Direct, retail, and wholesale distribution channels and networks<li>Marketing communications and promotions<li>Advertising, public relations, and choice of media<li>Pricing for profitability<li>Personal selling and sales management<li>Customer relationship management and customer privacy<li>Customer acquisition, retention, and dismissal<li>Basic math for making marketing decisions</ul></p><p>Timeless yet timely, this book provides valuable background information for understanding and interpreting business and competition from a marketing point of view. That makes it useful in both formal and informal educational settings, including on-the-job training.

By measuring and analyzing as you grow, you can validate whether a problem is real, find the right customers, and decide what to build, how to monetize it, and how to spread the word. Focusing on the One Metric That Matters to your business <i>right now</i> gives you the focus you need to move ahead--and the discipline to know when to change course. <br><br>Written by Alistair Croll (Coradiant, CloudOps, Startupfest) and Ben Yoskovitz (Year One Labs, GoInstant), the book lays out practical, proven steps to take your startup from initial idea to product/market fit and beyond. Packed with over 30 case studies, and based on a year of interviews with over a hundred founders and investors, the book is an invaluable, practical guide for Lean Startup practitioners everywhere."},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h4>Q&A with Alistair Croll, coauthor of \"Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster\"</h4> <p><strong>Q. Why is your book timely-- what makes it important right now?</strong></p> <p>A. There's been a flurry of startup activity made possible by the lowered barriers to entry of cloud computing, social media, and app platforms. But there's less accountability. If you look at the numbers, it's a bloodbath: you're almost certain to fail. One reason for this is that founders are delusional. But data doesn't lie, and the right data in the right place at the right time can change your business (to steal from Steward Brand.) That's what this book is about-- using data to build a better business faster.</p> <p><strong>Q. What information do you hope that readers of your book will walk away with?</strong></p> <p>A. We have a ton of concrete data-- ideas of what's normal; what metric to watch at what time; and so on. But more than any of this, we hope they'll come away with an experimental eye, realizing that they're not building a product. Instead, they're building a tool to figure out what product to build.</p> <p><strong>Q. What's the most exciting and/ or important thing happening in your space?</strong></p> <p>A. That nearly every mature industry is ripe for disruption. An entrepreneur, working within a host organization, can absolutely revitalize the business (as Procter & Gamble did when it introduced Swiffer, for example.) And a small business can tackle giants or entrenched competitors by being more agile (as Uber did to taxis, or Airbnb did to hotels.) Mops, taxis, and rentals aren't new. But they're hugely susceptible to change if it's applied in a measured, careful way.</p> </div>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Statistics","id":"10020691011"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Alistair Croll","Benjamin Yoskovitz"],"Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"O'Reilly Media","EAN":"9781449335670","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601200584684","4708364244493","9781449335670","8601419220731"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"O Reilly Media","ISBN":"1449335675","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Weight":"135","Width":"150"},"Label":"O'Reilly Media","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3499","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$34.99"},"Manufacturer":"O'Reilly Media","MPN":"43171-557020","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"440","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"160","Length":"910","Weight":"135","Width":"640"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"43171-557020","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2013-03-21","Publisher":"O'Reilly Media","Studio":"O'Reilly Media","Title":"Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster (Lean Series)"}}}},{"id":"1449372864","data":{"width":54,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2410,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$24.10"},"asin":"1449372864","link":"https://www.amazon.com/UX-Strategy-Innovative-Digital-Products/dp/1449372864?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1449372864","url":"https://www.amazon.com/UX-Strategy-Innovative-Digital-Products/dp/1449372864?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1449372864","salesRank":33896,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51EVg9SGmGL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"108"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51EVg9SGmGL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"337"},"title":"UX Strategy: How to Devise Innovative Digital Products that People Want","similar":["1491923539","149195129X","1491921560","1491904909","0321965515","1491953608","1491912685","1491911689","0321767535","193382011X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1449372864&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A16Z&v=2&sig=j1hDQMk0eXX9l%252FgC3vtgCZzGHnaUlN19xg0tby9osOE%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div><p>User experience (UX) strategy requires a careful blend of business strategy and UX design, but until now, there hasn’t been an easy-to-apply framework for executing it.

You wear a certain jacket because you liked how it looked. You picked a particular career because you found it interesting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions is patently obvious. Right? Wrong.<BR> <BR>Without our realizing it, other people’s behavior has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane to the momentous. Even strangers have an impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes toward a welfare policy shift if we’re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans (even though the policy is the same). But social influence doesn’t just lead us to do the same things as others. In some cases we imitate others around us. But in other cases we <i>avoid</i> particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream.

Halbert, explaining insider tactics and sage wisdom to his youngest son Bond. Once only available as part of a paid monthly premium, The Boron Letters are unique in the marketing universe and now they are a bona fide cult classic among direct response marketers and copywriters around the world. The letters inside are written from a father to a son, in a loving way that goes far beyond a mere sales book or fancy \"boardroom\" advertising advice... It's more than a Master's Degree in selling & persuasion…it's hands-down the best SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE training on how to convince people to buy your products or services than I have ever read. The Boron Letters contain knowledge well beyond selling. The letters also explain how to navigate life's hurdles. This marketing classic is personal and easily digestible. Plus... immediately after reading the first chapters, you can go out and make money and a real, noticeable difference in your marketplace. There are very few successful direct response marketers (online or off) who don't owe something to Gary Halbert…and for many of them, The Boron Letters is the crown jewel in their collection. Copywriters and marketers read and re-read The Boron Letters over and over again for a reason. These strategies, secrets and tips are going to be relevant 5, 10, even 100 years from now because they deal honestly with the part of human psychology which never changes, how to convince and convert folks into buyers. Bottom line? Read the first chapter. Get into the flow of Gary's mind. Then read the second. I dare you to NOT finish the entire darn thing. After you put a few of the lessons into practice, you too will find yourself reading The Boron Letters again and again like so many of today’s top marketers.

Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to <i>Fortune</i> magazine. Dalio himself has been named to <i>Time </i>magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.<BR> <BR> In <i>Principles, </i>Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, <i>Principles</i> also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.<BR> <BR>Here, from a man who has been called both “the Steve Jobs of investing” and “the philosopher king of the financial universe” (<i>CIO </i>magazine), is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Personal Finance","id":"2717"},{"name":"Organizational Learning","id":"171127"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Ray Dalio","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Unknown","EAN":"9781501124020","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781501124020"},"IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1501124021","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Weight":"183","Width":"160"},"Label":"Simon & Schuster","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"3000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$30.00"},"Manufacturer":"Simon & Schuster","MPN":"9781501124020","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"592","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"157","Length":"913","Weight":"185","Width":"598"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9781501124020","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-09-19","Publisher":"Simon & Schuster","ReleaseDate":"2017-09-19","Studio":"Simon & Schuster","Title":"Principles: Life and Work"}}}},{"id":"1501197274","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1651,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.51"},"asin":"1501197274","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1501197274?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1501197274","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1501197274?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1501197274","salesRank":242,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xzLNSJ94L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xzLNSJ94L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"329"},"title":"The Courage to Be Disliked: The Japanese Phenomenon That Shows You How to Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness","similar":["0735216355","0195374614","0399184139","1477800832","1590514831","1732265100","1610398270","0062452991","042528462X","0306825465"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1501197274&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A12Z&v=2&sig=ep97p9sOLbfqFlwZcTEHXCxbgQM0BSbqSrHAgLTXitM%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>Reading this book could change your life.</b><BR> <BR><b>“Marie Kondo, but for your brain” (HelloGiggles).</b><BR> <BR><b>“Compelling from front to back.

Fear of choosing “wrong” was holding me back. I knew that product selection was key to success so I needed to choose right. Another part of the problem was I had bigger ideas—I wanted to create a brand and I had some ideas as to what sorts of products I would carry. But those ideas required more capital than I was willing to invest for my first product. As a result, I put so much pressure on myself to dream big and think towards the future that I did…nothing! Another hold up was I was a little skittish to follow the advice to source from Chinese suppliers. It seemed so complicated for a beginner. Could I not take a little less profit and source domestically? Were there not manufacturers that could produce my ideas in North America? Yes, and yes. Ultimately the delays helped me because I learned a lot by joining Facebook groups and listening to and learning from the experiences of others. I devoured the advice in forums as well as blogs, books, webinars, and courses. I learned of the pitfalls of private label that the gurus selling you the dream never talk about. And finally, I did pull the trigger. I put together this guide to help any of you who are feeling a little gun-shy too. I put this book together for all of you who have the brains to say “Hey, if everyone buys top 100 selling products wont that saturate the market?” I put this book together to help you find great products from many different approaches. After reading this, you should feel confident enough to find a product and get started with your e-commerce business."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Small Business & Entrepreneurship","id":"2741"},{"name":"E-Commerce","id":"541256"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Renae Clark","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781537483733","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781537483733"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"1537483730","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"550","Width":"14"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"699","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$6.99"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","NumberOfPages":"62","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"30","Length":"870","Weight":"25","Width":"520"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2015-10-15","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"Product Research 101: Find Winning Products to Sell on Amazon and Beyond"}}}},{"id":"1538727935","data":{"width":54.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2040,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$20.40"},"asin":"1538727935","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Storynomics-Story-Driven-Marketing-Post-Advertising-World/dp/1538727935?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1538727935","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Storynomics-Story-Driven-Marketing-Post-Advertising-World/dp/1538727935?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1538727935","salesRank":27028,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KuNj3QhGL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"109"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KuNj3QhGL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"340"},"title":"Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World","similar":["1119483352","099443281X","1683506111","1455591912","0718033329","0060391685","154642458X","085719609X","161448502X","1404107215"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1538727935&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A01Z&v=2&sig=zpACnIJvca5ne7RfS0ZUGLop14FC%252BL1ZLLkdhVL0qZs%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Based on the worldwide seminar offered by the legendary story master Robert McKee and Skyword CEO Tom Gerace -- STORYNOMICS translates the lessons of storytelling in business into economic and leadership success.

Reid, bestselling author of Three Feet from Gold</i> <br> <br> The 7 Critical Principles of Effective Digital Marketing is an attempt at establishing a baseline for one of the most tumultuous and change-ridden industries in existence. It takes a step back from the strategies and tactics that most digital marketing approaches start with and, instead, establishes a core and foundational structure from which all digital marketing initiatives can and should operate. The 7 Principles are simple without being simplistic and help to align digital marketers with a set of axiomatic, unchanging and foundational beliefs. In fact, these 7 principles may be the only thing about digital marketing that won’t change. <br> <br> A note from the author: <br> Oh, look! You’re reading the synopsis. That means I’ve got another sentence or two before you get bored and jump ship to go roam greener pastures. I get that, I do the same thing all of the time. Here’s the problem with my book: That sexy little tidbit that you’re looking for...you know, that hint, tip, trick, hack, best practice, “whatever” that’ll make you an instant digital marketing demigod...it ain't here. I’m not saying it doesn’t exist. I’m not saying Santa doesn’t exist either. <br> <br> Here’s what I am saying: maybe, just maybe, we’re doing this wrong. I said “we” because I’m one of you! I’m a professional digital marketer (10 years and running!) and I do the same stupid thing that all of us are guilty of. I go out hunting for quick-fix content that’ll give me some sort of blueprint to success as if digital marketing genius comes in a template. That’s exactly why I wrote this book. <br> <br> Yes, strategies, tactics and best practices are important. But more important than any of that, something truly irreplaceable and a prerequisite to any lasting success: Principles. Here’s the problem that I face: Principles aren’t sexy! They just aren’t. Tips and hacks and all of that crap, easy to sell. But principles…? Yawn! <br> <br> So, dear reader, I issue you a warning: if you’re looking for that casual read that’ll just drop a couple of little nuggets to simply make you sound smart the next time you’re at a conference, I invite you to look elsewhere. (You’re looking for dessert and I’m offering up that deep-dish beef stew your mom used to make on rainy days.) However, if you want the real deal, feet on the street, decade in the making, principle-centered, value driven, foundational approach to digital marketing: You found it. <br> <br> It’s time we put down our plastic spiderman sporks and pick up the fine silver so we can sit at the big boy table with every other industry. It's time for digital marketing to have a principle-centered foundation. I hope you’ll join me. <br> <br> Thug life, <br> Kasim <br> <br>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Marketing","id":"2702"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Kasim Aslam","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9781542991001","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781542991001"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"1542991005","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"51"},"Label":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1229","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$12.29"},"Manufacturer":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","NumberOfPages":"226","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"51","Length":"900","Weight":"89","Width":"600"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-02-16","Publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Studio":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","Title":"The 7 Critical Principles of Effective Digital Marketing"}}}},{"id":"1544500629","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1999,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$19.99"},"asin":"1544500629","link":"https://www.amazon.com/One-Many-Secret-Webinar-Success/dp/1544500629?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1544500629","url":"https://www.amazon.com/One-Many-Secret-Webinar-Success/dp/1544500629?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1544500629","salesRank":142540,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41s%2BmRZiOaL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41s%2BmRZiOaL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"324"},"title":"One to Many: The Secret to Webinar Success","similar":["161448502X","1683504585","1599186071","1939447720","1946633135","1942589255","0525534016","1630474770","1941870848","0692094555"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1544500629&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A16Z&v=2&sig=tmZmgq8Gqg1Ka1sgL6705Run0HbtB8lsmZpVkFef48g%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"It's no secret that the right type of webinar can easily double or triple your business profits.

If you need to rally fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers around an idea, this book will demystify the process.<br>  <br> It's human nature to seek out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads).  Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. Social media gives anyone who wants to make a difference the tools to do so. <br>  <br> With his signature wit and storytelling flair, Godin presents the three steps to building a tribe: the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead.<br>  <br> If you think leadership is for other people, think again—leaders come in surprising packages.

Under such pressure to stay alive—let alone grow—it’s easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in a never-ending cycle of “sell it—do it, sell it—do it” that leaves them exhausted, frustrated, and unable to get ahead no matter how hard they try. <p></p><p>This is the exact situation Mike Michalowicz found himself in when he was trying to grow his first company. Although it was making steady money, there was never very much left over and he was chasing customers left and right, putting in twenty-eight-hour days, eight days a week. The punishing grind never let up. His company was alive but stunted, and he was barely breathing. That’s when he discovered an unlikely source of inspiration—pumpkin farmers. </p><p></p><p>After reading an article about a local farmer who had dedicated his life to growing giant pump­kins, Michalowicz realized the same process could apply to growing a business. He tested the Pumpkin Plan on his own company and transformed it into a remarkable, multimillion-dollar industry leader. First he did it for himself. Then for others. And now you. So what is the Pumpkin Plan?</p><p></p><ul> <li>Plant the right seeds: Don’t waste time doing a bunch of different things just to please your customers. Instead, identify the thing you do better than anyone else and focus all of your attention, money, and time on figuring out how to grow your company doing it.</li> <li>Weed out the losers: In a pumpkin patch small, rotten pumpkins stunt the growth of the robust, healthy ones. The same is true of customers. Figure out which customers add the most value and provide the best opportunities for sustained growth. Then ditch the worst of the worst.</li> <li>Nurture the winners: Once you figure out who your best customers are, blow their minds with care. Discover their unfulfilled needs, innovate to make their wishes come true, and overdeliver on every single promise.</li></ul><p></p><p>Full of stories of other successful entrepreneurs, <i>The Pumpkin Plan</i> guides you through unconven­tional strategies to help you build a truly profitable blue-ribbon company that is the best in its field.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Venture Capital","id":"10020679011"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"},{"name":"Marketing","id":"355574011"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Mike Michalowicz","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Portfolio Hardcover","EAN":"9781591844884","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9781591844884","8601421292085","8601400965207"]},"Edition":"1st","Feature":"Portfolio Hardcover","ISBN":"1591844886","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"625","Weight":"100","Width":"85"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2695","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$26.95"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"240","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"900","Weight":"100","Width":"620"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2012-07-05","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2012-07-05","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"The Pumpkin Plan: A Simple Strategy to Grow a Remarkable Business in Any Field"}}}},{"id":"1591845335","data":{"width":57,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1295,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$12.95"},"asin":"1591845335","link":"https://www.amazon.com/All-Marketers-are-Liars-Works-/dp/1591845335?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1591845335","url":"https://www.amazon.com/All-Marketers-are-Liars-Works-/dp/1591845335?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1591845335","salesRank":8750,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51j6ieM83XL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"114"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51j6ieM83XL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"357"},"title":"All Marketers are Liars: The Underground Classic That Explains How Marketing Really Works--and Why Authenticity Is the Best Marketing of All","similar":["1591842336","014101640X","1451686587","0684856360","0749939753","1591844096","1119341205","0134172817","1591841666","0718033329"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1591845335&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A58%3A59Z&v=2&sig=0OIoBQ2%252Blx9M2CsdrUvIqTCWObep1T6LQo1yWzRZv4E%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>The indispensable classic on marketing by the bestselling author of <i>Tribes</i> and <i>Purple Cow</i>.<br></b><br> Legendary business writer Seth Godin has three essential questions for every marketer:<br><br> “What’s your story?”<br><br> “Will the people who need to hear this story believe it?”<br><br> “Is it true?” <br><br> All marketers tell stories. And if they do it right, we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche is vastly superior to a $36,000 Volkswagen that’s virtually the same car. We believe that $225 sneakers make our feet feel better—and look cooler—than a $25 brand. And believing it makes it true.<br><br> As Seth Godin has taught hundreds of thousands of marketers and students around the world, great marketers don’t talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story—a story we want to believe, whether it’s factual or not. In a world where most people have an infinite number of choices and no time to make them, every organization is a marketer, and all marketing is about telling stories.<br><br> Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner, or Fiji water, or the iPod.<br><br> But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous, when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. That’s a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers, cigarette companies, and sleazy politicians.<br><br> But for the rest of us, it’s time to embrace the power of the story. As Godin writes, “Stories make it easier to understand the world. Stories are the only way we know to spread an idea. Marketers didn’t invent storytelling. They just perfected it.”"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Advertising","id":"2699"},{"name":"Research","id":"2709"},{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","id":"226685"},{"name":"Communication & Media Studies","id":"13022421"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Seth Godin","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Godin Seth","EAN":"9781591845331","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9781591845331","0884457843409","8601200647754","8601404418563"]},"Edition":"Reprint","Feature":"All Marketers Are Liars The Underground Classic That Explains How Marketing Really Works And Why Authenticity Is the Best Marketing of All","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"1591845335","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"700","Length":"500","Weight":"60","Width":"50"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$16.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"240","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"71","Length":"661","Weight":"15","Width":"500"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2012-04-24","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2012-04-24","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"All Marketers are Liars: The Underground Classic That Explains How Marketing Really Works--and Why Authenticity Is the Best Marketing of All","UPC":"884457843409","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"884457843409"}}}}},{"id":"1591845823","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1200,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$12.00"},"asin":"1591845823","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without/dp/1591845823?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1591845823","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without/dp/1591845823?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1591845823","salesRank":12585,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rnVy7CfyL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rnVy7CfyL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"332"},"title":"Built to Sell: Creating a Business That Can Thrive Without You","similar":["0887307280","159184746X","B00VHZT4W2","0986019526","1450709842","1591844975","1591847249","073521414X","1626340846","014310960X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1591845823&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A05Z&v=2&sig=jW0zqI00%252F8Wa%252BMC4CPK2%252FT6xYPZZfJ4U3Ylz2OVvuo0%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>Run your company.

It's all the more relevant today. <br><br><i>Trust Me, I’m Lying</i> was the first book to blow the lid off the speed and force at which rumors travel online—and get \"traded up\" the media ecosystem until they become real headlines and generate real responses in the real world. The culprit?

Often someone like Ryan Holiday. <br>  <br> As he explains, “I wrote this book to explain how media manipulators work, how to spot their fingerprints, how to fight them, and how (if you must) to emulate their tactics. Why am I giving away these secrets?

In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back. <br> <br><i>Ego Is the Enemy </i>draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to his­tory. We meet fascinating figures such as George Marshall, Jackie Robinson, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, who all reached the highest levels of power and success by con­quering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well. <br> <br>In an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion, the battle against ego must be fought on many fronts.

That’s called traction, and it makes everything else easier—fund-raising, hiring, press, partnerships, acquisitions. Talk is cheap, but traction is hard evidence that you’re on the right path.<br><br><i>Traction </i>will teach you the nineteen channels you can use to build a customer base, and how to pick the right ones for your business. It draws on inter-views with more than forty successful founders, including Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia), Alexis Ohanian (reddit), Paul English (Kayak), and Dharmesh Shah (HubSpot). You’ll learn, for example, how to: <br> <br>·Find and use offline ads and other channels your competitors probably aren’t using<br>·Get targeted media coverage that will help you reach more customers<br>·Boost the effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns by automating staggered sets of prompts and updates<br>·Improve your search engine rankings and advertising through online tools and research<br><br>Weinberg and Mares know that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution; every startup faces unique challenges and will benefit from a blend of these nineteen traction channels. They offer a three-step framework (called Bullseye) to figure out which ones will work best for your business. But no matter how you apply them, the lessons and examples in <i>Traction</i> will help you create and sustain the growth your business desperately needs.</p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Marketing","id":"2702"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"},{"name":"New Business Enterprises","id":"2751"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Gabriel Weinberg","Justin Mares"],"Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Portfolio","EAN":"9781591848363","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781591848363"},"Feature":"Portfolio","ISBN":"1591848369","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"931","Length":"625","Weight":"80","Width":"86"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2795","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.95"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","MPN":"9781591848363","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"240","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"110","Length":"890","Weight":"80","Width":"630"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9781591848363","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2015-10-06","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2015-10-06","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth"}}}},{"id":"1599184494","data":{"width":64,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1793,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.93"},"asin":"1599184494","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Twitter-Business-Characters/dp/1599184494?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1599184494","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Twitter-Business-Characters/dp/1599184494?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1599184494","salesRank":979561,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510vXf4%2BP3L._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"128"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510vXf4%2BP3L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"400"},"title":"Ultimate Guide to Twitter for Business: Generate Quality Leads Using Only 140 Characters, Instantly Connect with 300 million Customers in 10 Minutes, ... that Can be Applied Now (Ultimate Series)","similar":["1599186020","159918611X","1599185601","1599185105","1599185083","1599186128","1599185784","1599185342","1599186195","1599184427"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=1599184494&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A07Z&v=2&sig=40POTDOy%252BOEBA7ft2AEknToByut8VsPuK3BApGtJ38A%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<div>Who should you follow?

In this classic bestsellerone of the most influential business books of all timeinnovation expert Clayton Christensen shows how even the most outstanding companies can do everything rightyet still lose market leadership.<br><BR>Christensen explains why most companies miss out on new waves of innovation. No matter the industry, he says, a successful company with established products <I>will</I> get pushed aside unless managers know how and when to abandon traditional business practices.<BR><BR>Offering both successes and failures from leading companies as a guide, <I>The Innovator’s Dilemma</I> gives you a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.<br><BR>Sharp, cogent, and provocativeand consistently noted as one of the most valuable business ideas of all time<I>The Innovator’s Dilemma</I> is the book no manager, leader, or entrepreneur should be without.<BR></div>"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"What do the Honda Supercub, Intel's 8088 processor, and hydraulic excavators have in common? They are all examples of disruptive technologies that helped to redefine the competitive landscape of their respective markets. These products did not come about as the result of successful companies carrying out sound business practices in established markets. In <I>The Innovator's Dilemma</I>, author Clayton M. Christensen shows how these and other products cut into the low end of the marketplace and eventually evolved to displace high-end competitors and their reigning technologies.<P> At the heart of <I>The Innovator's Dilemma</I> is how a successful company with established products keeps from being pushed aside by newer, cheaper products that will, over time, get better and become a serious threat. Christensen writes that even the best-managed companies, in spite of their attention to customers and continual investment in new technology, are susceptible to failure no matter what the industry, be it hard drives or consumer retailing. Succinct and clearly written, <I>The Innovator's Dilemma</I> is an important book that belongs on every manager's bookshelf. Highly recommended. <I>--Harry C.

Ebner argues that, in content marketing, authorial voice is the key to storytelling, tone helps establish long-term brand authenticity and shared emotional experiences are why viewers become subscribers and subscribers become customers.

The first step will fix that. </span><br /><br /><span>Step two</span><span> shows readers how to create a Brand Playbook which draws out and documents submarkets, key messages and other information critical to producing more leads, higher sales and a strong brand. </span><br /><br /><span>Steps three and four</span><span> explain the pros and cons of promotional mix channels and shows how to schedule promotions. </span><br /><br /><span>Steps five and six</span><span> help coax out highly productive campaigns from your amazingly talented creative staff. </span><br /><br /><span>While the title suggests this book is only for CEOs--the subtitle points out that it's not. If you are a marketing manager, writer, graphic designer or anyone else who has a hand in marketing, you should buy this book and read it before your CEO does. After all, as a marketing professional, you should know more about marketing than your CEO. You don't want to be caught flat-footed or off guard. </span><span>The CEO's Guide to Marketing</span><span> will make you the smartest marketer in the room, and that's no kidding around. You are going to wish you had this book years ago. </span><br /><br /><span>Many marketing departments struggle to produce promotional campaigns that </span><span>boost sales</span><span>. It's not because the team members aren't skilled or motivated. It's not because the product is poor or the economy isn't cooperating. Often, campaigns fail because they were constructed without a unified process. This can produce gaps in promotional schedules; ineffective marketing materials; and a stressed, confused or demoralized marketing staff.</span><br /><br /><span>Strategically Aimed Marketing--</span><span>SAM 6</span><span>®</span><span>--eliminates these challenges and improves your team's marketing by organizing their efforts. It uses a streamlined, six-step process that's easy to implement, fun to follow and amazingly effective.

Instead, the information found inside of the 21 chapters lays out a step-by-step formula for the two things online entrepreneurs care about most: <br><br> 1. Building a large following FAST. <br> 2. Converting those followers into DOLLARS. <br><br> The old way of being successful on social media meant that you had to spend a small fortune to build your following, then light your marketing dollars on fire trying to figure out Facebook ads. <br><br> Instagram Secrets completely demolishes the old way entrepreneurs were taught to use social media to grow their businesses. Now, anybody (even if you have ZERO Instagram followers) can generate an ENDLESS FLOOD of warm, cheap and targeted leads on demand. The warmer the lead, the easier the sale. The cheaper the lead, the higher the profit. <br><br> Wasting weeks or months on “testing” is now a thing of the past. You can now test your website, landing page, and sales funnels in just a few hours and make the necessary tweaks that will put you on the fast track to profitability. <br><br> There is a HUGE misconception about what it really means to be successful on social media: Having tons of followers is great, but it’s meaningless if it doesn’t make you money. Getting likes makes you feel good, but you can’t pay your bills with Instagram likes. Getting leads makes it seem like you are winning, but leads without sales are useless. <br><br> Those who LOSE on Instagram treat it like a popularity contest to fuel their ego. Winning on Instagram is simple: Just follow the blueprint Jeremy reveals in this book. <br><br> Will Instagram Secrets work for you? Yes. The pure gold packed from cover-to-cover in this book is not THEORY by the latest “Insta-Fake Guru.” The author, Jeremy McGilvrey wrote the book after learning DIRECTLY from Jason Stone, aka @Millionaire_Mentor who to date has 2.4 million followers, built and email list of 350,000 loyal subscribers and netted well over $2,000,000 using only Instagram. <br><br> Jeremy wrote Instagram Secrets the same way Napoleon Hill wrote the all-time personal development best seller Think and Grow Rich. Hill interviewed billionaire businessman Andrew Carnegie to learn the secrets behind how he achieved his unheard-of success and indestructible WEALTH. He then simplified Carnegie’s teachings into the first ever roadmap for attaining extraordinary financial success. Similarly, McGilvrey distilled Jason Stone’s vast knowledge into the most comprehensive book ever written for building a massive Instagram following and turning those followers into dollars. <br> <br> Not only did McGilvrey STUDY with the best, he also APPLIED everything he learned from @Millionaire_Mentor to build two Instagram pages to a combined 312,567 followers in under 15 months, collect 35,456 email leads in 7 months and earn daily predictable profits from Instagram. <br><br> Instagram Secrets was written with the goal of helping entrepreneurs completely bypass the years of pain, suffering and failure associated with building a profitable business and help them to achieve massive online success in record time. <br><br> If you are looking for another cookie-cutter training about how to become Insta-Famous Instagram Secrets is not for you. But, if you are serious about using Instagram to grow your following fast, get leads, make sales and build a profitable business...Then pick up your copy of Instagram Secrets today."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"E-Commerce","id":"541256"},{"name":"Web Marketing","id":"3563"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Jeremy McGilvrey","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Unknown","EAN":"9780692873953","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780692873953"},"ISBN":"0692873953","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"58"},"Label":"Jeremy McGilvrey","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1997","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$19.97"},"Manufacturer":"Jeremy McGilvrey","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"228","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"900","Weight":"75","Width":"600"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-04-14","Publisher":"Jeremy McGilvrey","Studio":"Jeremy McGilvrey","Title":"Instagram Secrets: The Underground Playbook for Growing Your Following Fast, Driving Massive Traffic & Generating Predictable Profits"}}}},{"id":"159918611X","data":{"width":64,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1455,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$14.55"},"asin":"159918611X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Facebook-Advertising-Potential/dp/159918611X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=159918611X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Facebook-Advertising-Potential/dp/159918611X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=159918611X","salesRank":35194,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CzdS9I8fL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"128"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CzdS9I8fL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"399"},"title":"Ultimate Guide to Facebook Advertising: How to Access 1 Billion Potential Customers in 10 Minutes (Ultimate Series)","similar":["1599186128","1599186020","0999308408","1599186195","1599185784","1979286973","1599185059","0692873953","1983805912","1599186233"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=159918611X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A58%3A59Z&v=2&sig=pZ%252BDP7NJbRAsJi5%252FsExEpY4qy60O4Se3M20yn6Tl3W0%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<h2>NEW CUSTOMERS ARE WAITING...<BR>FIND THEM ON FACEBOOK</h2>Facebook makes it easy for businesses like yours to share photos, videos, and posts to reach, engage, and sell to more than 1 billion active users.

The problem is, businesses are run by humans, and humans aren't always logical. Serial entrepreneur Mike Michalowicz has developed a behavioral approach to accounting to flip the formula: Sales - Profit = Expenses. Just as the most effective weight loss strategy is to limit portions by using smaller plates, Michalowicz shows that by taking profit first and apportioning only what remains for expenses, entrepreneurs will transform their businesses from cash-eating monsters to profitable cash cows. Using Michalowicz's Profit First system, readers will learn that:<br><br>· Following 4 simple principles can simplify accounting and make it easier to manage a profitable business by looking at bank account balances.<br>· A small, profitable business can be worth much more than a large business surviving on its top line.<br>· Businesses that attain early and sustained profitability have a better shot at achieving long-term growth.<br><br>With dozens of case studies, practical, step-by-step advice, and his signature sense of humor, Michalowicz has the game-changing roadmap for any entrepreneur to make money they always dreamed of."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Finance","id":"2604"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"},{"name":"Marketing","id":"355574011"},{"name":"International","id":"266108"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Mike Michalowicz","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"PORTFOLIO","EAN":"9780735214149","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780735214149"},"Edition":"Reissue","Feature":"PORTFOLIO","ISBN":"073521414X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"621","Weight":"84","Width":"80"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","MPN":"9780735214149","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"224","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"102","Length":"929","Weight":"84","Width":"646"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"9780735214149","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-02-21","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2017-02-21","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Profit First: Transform Your Business from a Cash-Eating Monster to a Money-Making Machine"}}}},{"id":"0470317248","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":7176,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$71.76"},"asin":"0470317248","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Market-Management-David-Aaker/dp/0470317248?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0470317248","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Market-Management-David-Aaker/dp/0470317248?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0470317248","salesRank":682332,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UOFEQnReL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UOFEQnReL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"334"},"title":"Strategic Market Management","similar":["0071763732","0061741205","1422144119","0718033329","0273778862","1305502140","1118729277","1305250907","0132664259","0143118757"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0470317248&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A58%3A59Z&v=2&sig=32ThtVJ8Z%252FqxZ8zgWsOPfBReTKGI20W5e980oSt%252FgXs%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Developing and implementing strategies today is very different than only a few decades ago; nearly all firms today operate in dynamic markets.  Completely revised and updated, Aaker's best-selling book, <b>Strategic Market Management</b>, helps managers identify, implement, prioritize, and adapt market-driven business strategies that will enjoy sustainable advantage in dynamic markets that are increasingly complex and cluttered.  The intent is to provide decision makers with concepts, methods, and procedures by which they can improve the quality of their strategic decision making and developing growth strategies."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Advertising","id":"2699"},{"name":"Marketing","id":"2702"},{"name":"Accounting","id":"266117"}],"attributes":{"Author":"David A.

Contrary to popular belief, they didn’t explode to massive worldwide popularity simply by building  a great product then crossing their fingers and hoping it would catch on. There was a studied, carefully implemented methodology behind these companies’ extraordinary rise.

Those members have made it to the Retention Point. And, when you do what I show you how to do in the book, you’ll get MORE of your members to the Retention Point so you can keep them longer and your recurring revenue will grow. </p> <p>Membership is a great business model in concept. You get a customer and each time your customer renews you get recurring revenue. But, even though I’d become a membership marketing expert I soon discovered it doesn’t matter how many new members you get if your members quit as fast as new members join. </p> <p>I just got off the phone with a prospective client for the first time. His team is generating more than 10,000 new members a month. That’s awesome, a great effort and commendable result that’s getting his company featured in many subscription industry profiles. What isn’t getting featured is this same company is losing 9500 members each month. This means they spend 95% of all of their marketing efforts replacing members that quit. Twenty-seven days of each month are spent replacing canceled members. Their marketing department has thirty days of monthly expenses but delivers only three days of growth.</p> <p>If you know of anyone that’s in this position, or if you are in this position, I’m revealing more than 25 years of membership growth experience in this new book called <i> Retention Point, The Single Biggest Secret to Membership and Subscription Growth for Associations, SAAS, Publishers, Digital Access, Subscription Boxes and all Membership and Subscription-Based Businesses.</i></p> When you get your hands on this book you'll discover:<br /> • The five fallacies of membership retention that most subscription businesses implement that actually INCREASE member churn rates.<br /> • Five case studies of subscription business turnarounds (or successful launches) including a publisher, a subscription box, SAAS, an association and a charity/nonprofit.<br /> • The 10 Retention Point Accelerators that transform your new members from Quitters into Lifers. <br /> • How to achieve 90% to 98% annual renewal percentages, even if you believe this is completely impossible for your business.<br /> • The single biggest misunderstanding subscription companies believe that kills membership growth.<br /> <p>Plus a whole lot more, when you get <i>Retention Point.</i></p>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Direct","id":"2703"},{"name":"Marketing","id":"491624"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Robert Skrob","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780692094556","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780692094556"},"Edition":"1","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0692094555","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"550","Width":"35"},"Label":"Membership Services, Inc.","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"997","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$9.97"},"Manufacturer":"Membership Services, Inc.","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"152","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"35","Length":"850","Weight":"56","Width":"550"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-05-04","Publisher":"Membership Services, Inc.","Studio":"Membership Services, Inc.","Title":"Retention Point: The Single Biggest Secret to Membership and Subscription Growth for Associations, SAAS, Publishers, Digital Access, Subscription ...

The mega ad agencies, guru marketing consultants, and giant advertising networks have concluded that the problem is us. We haven't given the marketing enough time. They’ve told us we’re not spending enough money to see substantial results. They’ve fed us bogus reports about website hits, social followers, and other unimportant data that doesn’t matter. The cost of marketing continues to rise while its effectiveness and ROI continue to decline. Most companies have responded by banging loudly on their marketing pots and pans in hopes of getting noticed. However, the problem remains. As our world becomes more digital, the marketing noise keeps getting louder. It’s time to think differently and stop spinning our marketing wheels acting like everyone else. It's time to stop making noise just to get new customers' attention. Success will never be found by just \"getting our names out there.\" In fact, most businesses could cut half of their marketing budgets without skipping a beat. The truth is, you don't need to hire more salespeople. You don't need more social followers. You don't even need more website traffic! What you need is a blueprint— a simple plan of action for your business. It’s time to focus your message and do marketing that matters. This short book outlines the four critical components of every successful marketing strategy. As you read, you'll suddenly realize there are businesses all around you applying these principles. They're quietly dominating their industries and are expanding at breakneck speed. Despite their success and how logical the Four Step Marketing process may be, most companies completely ignore all four of these timeless principles. Regardless of any preconceived ideas or what you've heard, you're sure to be challenged by this book. Written by an experienced team of entrepreneurial marketing executives, this fluff-free guide concisely outlines a refreshingly new and straight-forward approach to marketing. With less than 14,000 words, it’s the perfect little book for the busy entrepreneur or business leader looking for clarity and a winning strategy. In about an hour, you'll learn about the Four Step Marketing strategy and see why companies who follow these steps become unstoppable. Decide for yourself.

How can we create and market creative works that achieve longevity?<br><br>Holiday explores this mystery by drawing on his extensive experience working with businesses and creators such as Google, American Apparel, and the author John Grisham, as well as his interviews with the minds behind some of the greatest perennial sellers of our time. His fascinating examples include:<br><br>• Rick Rubin, producer for Adele, Jay-Z, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who teaches his artists to push past short-term thinking and root their work in long-term inspiration.<br>• Tim Ferriss, whose books have sold millions of copies, in part because he rigorously tests every element of his work to see what generates the strongest response.<br>• <i>Seinfeld</i>, which managed to capture both the essence of the nineties and timeless themes to become a modern classic.<br>• Harper Lee, who transformed a muddled manuscript into <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> with the help of the right editor and feedback.<br>• Winston Churchill, Stefan Zweig, and Lady Gaga, who each learned the essential tenets of building a platform of loyal, dedicated supporters.<br><br>Holiday reveals that the key to success for many perennial sellers is that their creators don’t distinguish between the making and the marketing. The product’s purpose and audience are in the creator’s mind from day one. By thinking holistically about the relationship between their audience and their work, creators of all kinds improve the chances that their offerings will stand the test of time."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Creativity","id":"4737"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Marketing","id":"2702"},{"name":"E-Commerce","id":"541256"},{"name":"Web

Godin argues that businesses can no longer rely solely on traditional forms of \"interruption advertising\" in magazines, mailings, or radio and television commercials. He writes that today consumers are bombarded by marketing messages almost everywhere they go. If you want to grab someone's attention, you first need to get his or her permission with some kind of bait--a free sample, a big discount, a contest, an 800 number, or even just an opinion survey. Once a customer volunteers his or her time, you're on your way to establishing a long-term relationship and making a sale. \"By talking only to volunteers, Permission Marketing guarantees that consumers pay more attention to the marketing message,\" he writes. \"It serves both customers and marketers in a symbiotic exchange.\"<p> Godin knows his stuff. He created Internet marketer Yoyodyne and sold it in 1998 to Yahoo!, where he is a vice president. Godin delves into the strategies of several companies that successfully practice permission marketing, including Amazon.com, American Airlines, Bell Atlantic, and American Express. Permission marketing works best on the Internet, he writes, because the medium eliminates costs such as envelopes, printing, and stamps. Instead of advertising with a plain banner ad on the Internet, you should focus on discovering the customer's problem and getting permission to follow up with e-mail, he writes. <I>Permission Marketing</I> is an important and valuable book for businesses seeking better results from their advertising. <i>--Dan

Ruth is incredibly level-headed in her approach to monetizing her blog and truly believes and promotes that a blog full of good ideas, content and writing must come first. My favorite part is that every chapter ends with a “plan of action” which is great if you are truly looking to improve your blog. I can’t wait to put her tips and ideas into action and watch my blog grow!“ -Maggie @ The Love Nerds"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Blogging & Blogs","id":"15375281"},{"name":"E-Commerce","id":"379367011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Ruth Soukup","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780692236512","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780692236512","8601418319696","0783324886917"]},"Edition":"2nd Edition","ISBN":"0692236511","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Weight":"63","Width":"48"},"Label":"Ruth Soukup","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1599","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$15.99"},"Manufacturer":"Ruth Soukup","MPN":"black & white illustrations","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"210","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"48","Length":"900","Weight":"83","Width":"600"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"black & white illustrations","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2014-07-19","Publisher":"Ruth Soukup","Studio":"Ruth Soukup","Title":"How To Blog For Profit: Without Selling Your Soul","UPC":"783324886917","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"783324886917"}}}}},{"id":"039957896X","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1563,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$15.63"},"asin":"039957896X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-One-Person-Business-Great-Money/dp/039957896X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=039957896X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Million-Dollar-One-Person-Business-Great-Money/dp/039957896X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=039957896X","salesRank":31817,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lSTYC8mkL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lSTYC8mkL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"The Million-Dollar, One-Person Business: Make Great Money.

A strategic \"way of life\" that, when properly executed, creates life-long customers, evangelical employees, helpful partners, and yes, some profit to boot. The title of this book is a redirect. The fortune being referred to is not money. The fortune is a combination of experiences, events, learnings, insights, and of course, luck. The real forces behind creating one's fortune are the principles an individual or business lives by. Principles are the external, arbitrary forces that affect human affairs and bring us good or bad fortune. And by good fortune, that doesn’t imply there will not be challenges along the way; rather, good fortune is a series of experiences, not a destination. Some call it chance or luck. Good fortune is propelled positively or stifled negatively by the principles we strive to live by. We shape our fortune by our principles. Living by principles and knowing who you really are (the best or worst parts), along with the hard and soft skills you have (or are willing to put in the time to master), are the basic ingredients for personal or business fortune. Principles can be practiced personally and professionally at work. Often folks have great personal principles, but often fall short on them at work. Why? Is it fear? Is it work culture? Actually, it’s a mixture of both. This book shares the principles that transformed RealTruck as a business."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Company Profiles","id":"2542"},{"name":"Workplace Culture","id":"2571"},{"name":"Automotive","id":"10020695011"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategy & Competition","id":"2553"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"},{"name":"New Business Enterprises","id":"2751"},{"name":"E-Commerce","id":"541256"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Scott J Bintz","Binding":"Paperback","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":"9780999623404"},"EAN":"9780999623404","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780999623404"},"Edition":"1","ISBN":"0999623400","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"900","Length":"600","Width":"54"},"Label":"Red Headed Rebel","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$19.95"},"Manufacturer":"Red Headed Rebel","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"214","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"54","Length":"900","Weight":"92","Width":"600"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-05-08","Publisher":"Red Headed Rebel","Studio":"Red Headed Rebel","Title":"Principles To Fortune - Crafting a Culture to Massively Grow a Business"}}}},{"id":"0735220034","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1669,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.69"},"asin":"0735220034","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Lose-Customer-Again-Lifelong/dp/0735220034?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735220034","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Lose-Customer-Again-Lifelong/dp/0735220034?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735220034","salesRank":21204,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UGg%2BGiGeL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UGg%2BGiGeL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"Never Lose a Customer Again: Turn Any Sale into Lifelong Loyalty in 100 Days","similar":["1732095604","161961457X","0738219207","1717596215","161961877X","1119480256","1292116897","0718033329","1984268945","073521414X"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0735220034&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A08Z&v=2&sig=UiWkPvfj%252FocUG1MuB%252BnXESWREPb9atG%252BmwSwmR4hzO0%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><b>Award-winning speaker and business consultant Joey Coleman teaches audiences and companies all over the world how to turn a one-time purchaser into a lifelong customer.</b></b><br><br>Coleman's theory of building customer loyalty isn't about focusing on marketing or closing the sale: It's about the First 100 Days® after the sale and the interactions the customer experiences. <br><br>While new customers experience joy, euphoria, and excitement, these feelings quickly shift to fear, doubt, and uncertainty as buyer's remorse sets in. Across all industries, somewhere between 20%-70% of newly acquired customers will stop doing business with a company with the first 100 days of being a new customer because they feel neglected in the early stages of customer onboarding.<br> <br>In <i>Never Lose a Customer Again</i>, Coleman offers a philosophy and methodology for dramatically increasing customer retention and as a result, the bottom line. He identifies eight distinct emotional phases customers go through in the 100 days following a purchase. From an impulse buy at Starbucks to the thoughtful purchase of a first house, all customers have the potential to experience the eight phases of the customer journey. If you can understand and anticipate the customers' emotions, you can apply a myriad of tools and techniques -- in-person, email, phone, mail, video, and presents -- to cement a long and valuable relationship.<br><br>Coleman's system is presented through research and case studies showing how best-in-class companies create remarkable customer experiences at each step in the customer lifecycle.<br> <br> In the \"Acclimate\" stage, customers need you to hold their hand and over-explain how to use your product or service. They're often too embarrassed to admit they're confused. Take a cue from Canadian software company PolicyMedical and their challenge of getting non-technical users to undergo a complex installation and implementation process. They turned a series of project spreadsheets and installation manuals into a beautiful puzzle customers could assemble after completing each milestone.<br> <br> In the \"Adopt\" stage, customers should be welcomed to the highest tier of tribal membership with both public and private recognitions. For instance, Sephora's VIB Rogue member welcome gift provides a metallic membership card (private recognition) and a members-only shade of lipstick (for public display).<br> <br> In the final stage, \"Advocate,\" loyal customers and raving fans are primed to provide powerful referrals. That's how elite entrepreneurial event MastermindTalks continues to sell-out their conference year after year - with zero dollars spent on marketing.

His company, Moz, maker of marketing software, is now a $45 million/year business, and he's one of the world's leading experts on SEO. But his business and reputation took fifteen years to grow, and his startup began not in a Harvard dorm room but as a mother-and-son family business that fell deeply into debt.<br><br>Now Fishkin pulls back the curtain on tech startup mythology, exposing the ups and downs of startup life that most CEOs would rather keep secret. For instance: A minimally viable product can be destructive if you launch at the wrong moment. Growth hacking may be the buzzword du jour, but initiatives can fizzle quickly. Revenue and growth won't protect you from layoffs. And venture capital always comes with strings attached. <br><br>Fishkin's hard-won lessons are applicable to any kind of business environment.

While early adopters are willing to sacrifice for the advantage of being first, the early majority waits until they know that the technology actually offers improvements in productivity. The challenge for innovators and marketers is to narrow this chasm and ultimately accelerate adoption across every segment. </p><p>This third edition brings Moore's classic work up to date with dozens of new examples of successes and failures, new strategies for marketing in the digital world, and Moore's most current insights and findings.

How can they create products that they are sure customers want to buy? Can innovation be more than a game of hit and miss? Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has the answer. A generation ago, Christensen revolutionized business with his groundbreaking theory of disruptive innovation. Now, he goes further, offering powerful new insights. <br /><br />After years of research, Christensen and his co-authors have come to one critical conclusion: our long held maxim--that understanding the customer is the crux of innovation--is wrong. Customers don't buy products or services; they \"hire\" them to do a job. Understanding customers does not drive innovation success, he argues. Understanding customer jobs does. The \"Jobs to Be Done\" approach can be seen in some of the world's most respected companies and fast-growing startups, including Amazon, Intuit, Uber, Airbnb, and Chobani yogurt, to name just a few. But this book is not about celebrating these successes--it's about predicting new ones. <br /><br />Christensen, Hall, Dillon, and Duncan contend that by understanding what causes customers to \"hire\" a product or service, any business can improve its innovation track record, creating products that customers not only want to hire, but that they'll pay premium prices to bring into their lives. Jobs theory offers new hope for growth to companies frustrated by their hit and miss efforts.<br /><br />This book carefully lays down the authors' provocative framework, providing a comprehensive explanation of the theory and why it is predictive, how to use it in the real world--and, most importantly, how not to squander the insights it provides."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Service","id":"16233451"},{"name":"Consumer Behavior","id":"2700"},{"name":"Education & Reference","id":"2732"},{"name":"Research & Development","id":"10020723011"},{"name":"Reference","id":"21"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Clayton M.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress—to measure what mattered.<br><br>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove (\"the greatest manager of his or any era\") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.<br><br>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization. <br><br>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention.<br><br>In <i>Measure What Matters</i>, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. This book will help a new generation of leaders capture the same magic."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Workplace Culture","id":"2571"},{"name":"Leadership","id":"2682"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategy & Competition","id":"2553"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","id":"2745"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"John Doerr","Binding":"Hardcover","Creator":"Larry Page","EAN":"9780525536222","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780525536222"},"ISBN":"0525536221","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"850","Length":"580","Weight":"95","Width":"110"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","MPN":"43192-806097","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"320","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"130","Length":"830","Weight":"95","Width":"560"},"PartNumber":"43192-806097","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-04-24","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2018-04-24","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs"}}}},{"id":"0735218072","data":{"width":62,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1890,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$18.90"},"asin":"0735218072","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Messy-Middle-Finding-Through-Hardest/dp/0735218072?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735218072","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Messy-Middle-Finding-Through-Hardest/dp/0735218072?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0735218072","salesRank":18481,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NwbPx0HrL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"124"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NwbPx0HrL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"389"},"title":"The Messy Middle: Finding Your Way Through the Hardest and Most Crucial Part of Any Bold Venture","similar":["1732265100","1524761419","1732265135","0525536221","1501197274","0525540830","1983017035","1591844118","1250194466","1328479250"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0735218072&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A10Z&v=2&sig=ZI%252Bk5pIFeigDZFe4rBIKevqq6U12rC3VyCzJ6jFSWGY%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><i>The Messy Middle</i> is the indispensable guide to navigating the volatility of new ventures and leading bold creative projects by Scott Belsky, bestselling author, entrepreneur, Chief Product Officer at Adobe, and product advisor to many of today's top start-ups.<br></b><br> Creating something from nothing is an unpredictable journey.

The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck?<br><br>Even the best decision doesn't yield the best outcome every time. There's always an element of luck that you can't control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making? <br><br>Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it's difficult to say \"I'm not sure\" in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don't always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don't always lead to bad outcomes.<br><br>By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you don't, you'll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You'll become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Decision-Making & Problem Solving","id":"2679"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"},{"name":"Decision Making","id":"10020716011"},{"name":"Cognitive Psychology","id":"573358"},{"name":"Cognitive","id":"15811861"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Annie Duke","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780735216358","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780735216358"},"ISBN":"0735216355","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"854","Length":"578","Weight":"90","Width":"100"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$26.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"288","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"98","Length":"850","Weight":"91","Width":"587"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-02-06","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2018-02-06","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts"}}}},{"id":"024134848X","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1699,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$16.99"},"asin":"024134848X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Simple-Drives/dp/024134848X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=024134848X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Simple-Drives/dp/024134848X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=024134848X","salesRank":4140,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5192h6lyGjL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5192h6lyGjL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"327"},"title":"Measure What Matters: OKRs: The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth","similar":["1720452679","0996006028","1119252393","1732265100","1501124021","0679762884","0691174954","1455582328","0988479702","1422184129"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=024134848X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A11Z&v=2&sig=pIvW%252BBC5VWFdVs0t7KxwJxG%252FzL8709qNGlYspb71iCQ%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Subjects","id":"1000"}],"attributes":{"Author":"John Doerr","Binding":"Paperback","EAN":"9780241348482","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780241348482"},"ISBN":"024134848X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"921","Length":"602","Weight":"99","Width":"91"},"Label":"Portfolio Penguin","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio Penguin","MPN":"27567130","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"94","Length":"917","Weight":"71","Width":"606"},"PartNumber":"27567130","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-04-26","Publisher":"Portfolio Penguin","Studio":"Portfolio Penguin","Title":"Measure What Matters: OKRs: The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth"}}}},{"id":"0525536469","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1718,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.18"},"asin":"0525536469","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Subscribed-Subscription-Model-Companys-Future/dp/0525536469?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0525536469","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Subscribed-Subscription-Model-Companys-Future/dp/0525536469?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0525536469","salesRank":13117,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41E8v%2BWRXHL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41E8v%2BWRXHL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"Subscribed: Why the Subscription Model Will Be Your Company's Future - and What to Do  About It","similar":["0071839321","0986406252","0692094555","098604623X","1119240867","159184746X","1732265100","1633696464","0525536221","1250092752"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0525536469&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A11Z&v=2&sig=qgbWni2s%252BOkiSHTm63%252FEgQ5gcCFo%252F53NUyYHCD2FgHg%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b>A <i>USA Today </i>bestseller! Companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Salesforce are just the tip of the iceberg for the subscription model. The real transformation--and the real opportunity--is just beginning.</b><br><br>Subscription companies are growing nine times faster than the S&P 500. Why? Because unlike product companies, subscription companies know their customers. A happy subscriber base is the ultimate economic moat. <br><br>Today's consumers prefer the advantages of access over the hassles of maintenance, from transportation (Uber, Surf Air), to clothing (Stitch Fix, Eleven James), to razor blades and makeup (Dollar Shave Club, Birchbox). Companies are similarly demanding easier, long-term solutions, trading their server rooms for cloud storage solutions like Box. Simply put, the world is shifting from products to services.<br><br>But how do you turn customers into subscribers? As the CEO of the world's largest subscription management platform, Tien Tzuo has helped hundreds of companies transition from relying on individual sales to building customer-centric, recurring-revenue businesses. His core message in <i>Subscribed</i> is simple: Ready or not, excited or terrified, you need to adapt to the Subscription Economy -- or risk being left behind.<br><br>Tzuo shows how to use subscriptions to build lucrative, ongoing one-on-one relationships with your customers. This may require reinventing substantial parts of your company, from your accounting practices to your entire IT architecture, but the payoff can be enormous. Just look at the case studies:<br><br>  <b>*</b>  Adobe transitions from selling enterprise software licenses to offering cloud-based solutions for a flat monthly fee, and quadruples its valuation.<br><br>  <b>*</b>  Fender evolves from selling guitars one at a time to creating lifelong musicians by teaching beginners to play, and keeping them inspired for life.<br><br>  <b>*</b>  Caterpillar uses subscriptions to help solve problems -- it's not about how many tractors you can rent, but how much dirt you need to move. <br><br>In <i>Subscribed,</i> you'll learn how these companies made the shift, and how you can transform your own product into a valuable service with a practical, step-by-step framework. Find out how how you can prepare and prosper now, rather than trying to catch up later."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Retailing","id":"2656"},{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Technical","id":"8298061011"},{"name":"Direct","id":"2703"},{"name":"Project Management","id":"8082407011"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Tien Tzuo","Gabe Weisert"],"Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780525536468","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780525536468"},"ISBN":"0525536469","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"928","Length":"622","Weight":"95","Width":"91"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$27.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"256","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"100","Length":"910","Weight":"95","Width":"590"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-06-05","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2018-06-05","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Subscribed: Why the Subscription Model Will Be Your Company's Future - and What to Do  About It"}}}},{"id":"0071839321","data":{"width":53,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1952,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$19.52"},"asin":"0071839321","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Membership-Economy-Forever-Transaction-Recurring/dp/0071839321?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0071839321","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Membership-Economy-Forever-Transaction-Recurring/dp/0071839321?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0071839321","salesRank":58801,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NTqws9hvL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"106"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NTqws9hvL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"331"},"title":"The Membership Economy: Find Your Super Users, Master the Forever Transaction, and Build Recurring Revenue","similar":["0986406252","159184746X","0525536469","0692094555","B00VHZT4W2","098604623X","1591847788","1119167965","1980406715","0814434436"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0071839321&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A11Z&v=2&sig=4wfiGEwdmxfmOM2T%252FyIWoH2ShQbRohBbccRVoyfkCp8%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>In today’s business world, it takes more than a website to stay competitive.

But customers can be fickle, markets shift, and competitors are ruthless. So how do you ensure a steady flow of repeat business? The secret—no matter what industry you’re in—is finding and keeping <em>automatic customers</em>.</strong><br /><br />These days virtually anything you need can be purchased through a subscription, with more convenience than ever before. Far beyond Spotify, Netflix, and <em>New York Times </em>subscriptions, you can sign up for weekly or monthly supplies of everything from groceries (AmazonFresh) to cosmetics (Birchbox) to razor blades (Dollar Shave Club).<br /><br />According to John Warrillow, this emerging subscription economy offers huge opportunities to companies that know how to turn customers into subscribers. Automatic customers are the key to increasing cash flow, igniting growth, and boosting the value of your company.<br /><br />Consider Whatsapp, the internet-based messaging service that was purchased by Facebook for $19 billion. While other services bombarded users with invasive ads in order to fund a free messaging platform, Whatsapp offered a refreshingly private tool on a subscription platform, charging just $1 per year. Their business model enabled the kind of service that customers wanted and ensured automatic customers for years to come.<br /><br />As Warrillow shows, subscriptions aren’t limited to technology or media businesses. Companies in nearly any industry, from start-ups to the Fortune 500, from home contractors to florists, can build subscriptions into their business.<br /><br />Warrillow provides the essential blueprint for winning automatic customers with one of the nine subscription business models, including: <ul> <li><strong>The Membership Website Model</strong>: Companies like The Wood Whisperer Guild, ContractorSelling.com, and DanceStudioOwner.com offer access to highly specialized, high quality information, recognizing that people will pay for good content. This model can work for any business with a tightly defined niche market and insider information.</li> <li><strong>The Simplifier Model</strong>: Companies like Mosquito Squad (pest control) and Hassle Free Homes (home maintenance) take a recurring task off your to-do list. Any business serving busy consumers can adopt this model not only to create a recurring revenue stream, but also to take advantage of the opportunity to cross-sell or bundle their services.</li> <li><strong>The Surprise Box Model</strong>: Companies like BarkBox (dog treats) and Standard Cocoa (craft chocolate) send their subscribers curated packages of goodies each month. If you can handle the logistics of shipping, giving customers joy in something new can translate to sales on your larger e-commerce site.</li> </ul> <br />This book also shows you how to master the psychology of selling subscriptions and how to reduce churn and provides a road map for the essential statistics you need to measure the health of your subscription business.<br /><br />Whether you want to transform your entire business into a recurring revenue engine or just pick up an extra 5 percent of sales growth, <em>The Automatic Customer</em> will be your secret weapon.<br /><strong><br

If not, it's time to boost your Growth IQ.</b><br><br>Trying to find the one right move that will improve your business's performance can feel overwhelming. But, as you'll discover in Growth IQ, there are just ten simple--but easily misunderstood--paths to growth, and every successful growth strategy can be boiled down to picking the right combination and sequence of these paths for your current context.<br><br>Tiffani Bova travels around the world helping companies solve their most vexing problem: how to keep growing in the face of stiff competition and a fast-changing business environment. Whether she's presenting to a Fortune 500 board of directors or brainstorming over coffee with a startup founder, Bova cuts through the clutter and confusion that surround growth.<br><br>Now, she draws on her decades of experience and more than thirty fascinating, in-depth business stories to demonstrate the opportunities--and pitfalls--of each of the ten growth paths, how they work together, and how they apply to business today. You'll see how, for instance:<br><br>  <b>*</b>  Red Bull broke Coca-Cola and PepsiCo's stranglehold on the soft drink market by taking the Customer Base Penetration path to establish a foothold with adventure sports junkies and expand into the mainstream.<br><br>  <b>*</b>  Marvel transformed itself from a struggling comic book publisher into a global entertainment behemoth by using a Customer and Product Diversification strategy and shifting their focus from comic books to comic book characters in movies.<br><br>  <b>*</b>  Starbucks suffered a brand crisis when they overwhelmed their customers with a Product Expansion strategy, and brought back CEO Howard Schultz to course-correct by returning to the Customer Experience path.<br><br>Through Bova's insightful analyses of these and many other case studies, you'll see why it can be a mistake to imitate strategies that worked for your competitors, or rely on strategies that worked for you in the past. To grow your company with confidence, you first need to grow your Growth IQ."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Management","id":"2683"},{"name":"Systems & Planning","id":"2694"},{"name":"Strategy & Competition","id":"2553"},{"name":"Marketing","id":"355574011"},{"name":"Organizational Change","id":"2688"},{"name":"Strategic Planning","id":"10020724011"},{"name":"Structural Adjustment","id":"10020725011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Tiffani Bova","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780525534402","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780525534402"},"ISBN":"0525534407","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"929","Length":"626","Width":"123"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2800","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$28.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"352","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"122","Length":"933","Weight":"120","Width":"642"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-08-14","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2018-08-14","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"Growth IQ: Get Smarter About the Choices that Will Make or Break Your Business"}}}},{"id":"0525540830","data":{"width":56.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":2400,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$24.00"},"asin":"0525540830","link":"https://www.amazon.com/This-Marketing-Cant-Until-Learn/dp/0525540830?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0525540830","url":"https://www.amazon.com/This-Marketing-Cant-Until-Learn/dp/0525540830?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0525540830","salesRank":81999,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UYILvuvtL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"113"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UYILvuvtL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"354"},"title":"This Is Marketing: You Can't Be Seen Until You Learn to See","similar":["1936891549","073521350X","0525428143","099443281X","1936891557","1732689806","1524761419","0525534016","0062874780","0525536515"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0525540830&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A12Z&v=2&sig=jBRz2ILp%252FRoM6PhnrOfN8rv6yuQBg5wdugVuT%252Bw9%252B80%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><b>Real marketing isn't about racking up clicks and tweets; it's about connection, empathy, and making a difference.</b></b><br><br>Over the past quarter century, Seth Godin has taught and inspired millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, leaders, and fans from all walks of life, via his blog, online courses, lectures, and bestselling books. He is the inventor of countless ideas and phrases that have made their way into mainstream business language, from Permission Marketing to Purple Cow to Tribes to The Dip. <br><br>Now, for the first time, Godin offers the core of his marketing wisdom in one accessible, timeless package. At the heart of his approach is a big idea: Great marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems. They don't just make noise; they make the world better. Truly powerful marketing is grounded in empathy, generosity, and emotional labor. <br><br>This book teaches you how to identify your smallest viable audience; draw on the right signals and signs to position your offering; build trust and permission with your target market; speak to the narratives your audience tells themselves about status, affiliation, and dominance; spot opportunities to create and release tension; and give people the tools to achieve their goals. <br><br>It's time for marketers to stop lying, spamming, and feeling guilty about their work. It's time to stop confusing social media metrics with true connections. It's time to stop wasting money on stolen attention that won't pay off in the long run. THIS IS MARKETING offers a better approach that will still apply for decades to come, no matter how the tactics of marketing continue to evolve."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Consumer Behavior","id":"2700"},{"name":"Multilevel","id":"2707"},{"name":"Skills","id":"355562011"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Seth Godin","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780525540830","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780525540830"},"ISBN":"0525540830","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"700","Length":"500","Width":"72"},"Label":"Portfolio","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"2400","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$24.00"},"Manufacturer":"Portfolio","NumberOfPages":"288","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"72","Length":"700","Weight":"72","Width":"500"},"ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2018-11-13","Publisher":"Portfolio","ReleaseDate":"2018-11-13","Studio":"Portfolio","Title":"This Is Marketing: You Can't Be Seen Until You Learn to See"}}}},{"id":"0994432801","data":{"width":52.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":639,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$6.39"},"asin":"0994432801","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Meaningful-Story-Ideas-That-Fly/dp/0994432801?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0994432801","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Meaningful-Story-Ideas-That-Fly/dp/0994432801?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0994432801","salesRank":362261,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41osOh8qRwL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"105"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41osOh8qRwL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"328"},"title":"Meaningful: The Story of Ideas That Fly","similar":["1500619213","1494842718","099443281X","0735214115","1489583947","1478394846","1119341205","125958965X","1936891549","1451686587"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0994432801&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A12Z&v=2&sig=4wC2sloj6MKIJ85yiIlWquEEBzSx%252F0uVTVQkHN0xqOU%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>“The most important book for your boss to read this year.”</p> <p>—SETH GODIN</p> <p>“Empathy, relevance, and affinity—three great concepts to help you make a dent in the universe.

Quincy Jones, Diane Keaton, Gloria Steinem, Julia Roberts, John Cleese and David Bowie are just a few of his celebrity alumni. Writers, producers, development executives and agents all flock to his lecture series, praising it as a mesmerizing and intense learning experience. <p> In <em>Story</em>, McKee expands on the concepts he teaches in his $450 seminars (considered a must by industry insiders), providing readers with the most comprehensive, integrated explanation of the craft of writing for the screen. No one better understands how all the elements of a screenplay fit together, and no one is better qualified to explain the \"magic\" of story construction and the relationship between structure and character than Robert McKee.</p>"},{"title":"Amazon.com Review","content":"Writing for the screen is quirky business. A writer must labor meticulously over his or her prose, yet very little of that prose is ever heard by filmgoers. The few words that do reach the audience, in the form of the characters' dialogue, are, according to Robert McKee, best left to last in the writing process. (\"As Alfred Hitchcock once remarked, 'When the screenplay has been written and the dialogue has been added, we're ready to shoot.' \") In <i>Story</i>, McKee puts into book form what he has been teaching screenwriters for years in his seminar on story structure, which is considered by many to be a prerequisite to the film biz. (The long list of film and television projects that McKee's students have written, directed, or produced includes <I>Air Force One</I>, <I>The Deer Hunter</I>, <I>E.R.</I>, <I>A Fish Called Wanda</I>, <I>Forrest Gump</I>, <I>NYPD Blue</I>, and <I>Sleepless in Seattle</I>.) Legions of writers flock to Hollywood in search of easy money, calculating the best way to get rich quick. This book is not for them. McKee is passionate about the art of screenwriting. \"No one needs yet another recipe book on how to reheat Hollywood leftovers,\" he writes. \"We need a rediscovery of the underlying tenets of our art, the guiding principles that liberate talent.\" <i>Story</i> is a true path to just such a rediscovery. In it, McKee offers so much sound advice, drawing from sources as wide ranging as Aristotle and <I>Casablanca</I>, Stanislavski and <I>Chinatown</I>, that it is impossible not to come away feeling immeasurably better equipped to write a screenplay and infinitely more inspired to write a brilliant one.<I>--Jane Steinberg</I>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Performing Arts","id":"521000"},{"name":"History & Criticism","id":"4495"},{"name":"Screenwriting","id":"4500"},{"name":"Fiction","id":"12022"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Robert McKee","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"ReganBooks","CatalogNumberList":{"CatalogNumberListElement":["POXM-0060391685","XM-0060391685"]},"Color":"Multicolor","EAN":"9780060391683","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780060391683","8601401343462","8580001055794"]},"Edition":"1","Feature":"Winner, International Moving Image Book Award","IsAdultProduct":"0","ISBN":"0060391685","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"925","Length":"613","Weight":"145","Width":"145"},"Label":"ReganBooks","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"4000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$40.00"},"Manufacturer":"ReganBooks","MPN":"22394673","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"480","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"200","Length":"950","Weight":"145","Width":"650"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"22394673","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"1997-11-25","Publisher":"ReganBooks","ReleaseDate":"1997-11-25","Studio":"ReganBooks","Title":"Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting"}}}},{"id":"085719609X","data":{"width":51.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1552,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$15.52"},"asin":"085719609X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Choice-Factory-behavioural-biases-influence/dp/085719609X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=085719609X","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Choice-Factory-behavioural-biases-influence/dp/085719609X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=085719609X","salesRank":403752,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51A3CsYvjSL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"103"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51A3CsYvjSL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"323"},"title":"The Choice Factory: 25 behavioural biases that influence what we buy","similar":["0999399004","0190311509","1118345606","1538727935","1544901054","0749482281","1784621927","0195573560","0195596269","1447287053"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=085719609X&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A13Z&v=2&sig=HiOAsEE43nm5uAV1lOCV3vHpAOhiIcBJn6nMm86Vd7Q%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Before you can influence decisions, you need to understand what drives them.

Inspirational technologist Shaku Atre, who rose from second-class citizen in an Indian village to prominence as one of the first women in technology AND, the legendary Hal Elrod creator of the bestselling Miracle Morning series of books. Exclusively for you at: http://nichedownbook.com/thankyou “Be known for a niche that you own. This is a powerful idea. One that transforms how people think about their lives, careers and business ventures.” -- Hal Elrod, author of the best-seller, The Miracle Morning: The Not-So-Obvious Secret Guaranteed to Transform Your Life Do you have the courage to stand out? From the inventor of cubism Pablo Picasso to Spanx founder Sarah Blakely, the people we admire most in the world are original, unique, different. They take risks, claim new ground. They do not fit in, they stand out. And they do not compete for attention in the traditional sense. Most of us are tricked into believing that achieving personal and professional success means fitting in. What it really takes is the courage to stand out. Are you ready? In this dynamic, direct and succinct book, Lochhead and Clancy describe a research-based approach to thinking about your life and business called “category design.” Through a narrative stuffed with inspiring stories, they examine how legendary people — especially legendary entrepreneurs — introduce the world to new ways of thinking and solving problems.

Thiel's sexuality had been known to close friends and family, but he didn't consider himself a public figure, and believed the information was private. <br><br>This post would be the casus belli for a meticulously plotted conspiracy that would end nearly a decade later with a $140 million dollar judgment against Gawker, its bankruptcy and with Nick Denton, Gawker's CEO and founder, out of a job. Only later would the world learn that Gawker's demise was not incidental--it had been masterminded by Thiel.<br><br>For years, Thiel had searched endlessly for a solution to what he'd come to call the \"Gawker Problem.\" When an unmarked envelope delivered an illegally recorded sex tape of Hogan with his best friend's wife, Gawker had seen the chance for millions of pageviews and to say the things that others were afraid to say. Thiel saw their publication of the tape as the opportunity he was looking for. He would come to pit Hogan against Gawker in a multi-year proxy war through the Florida legal system, while Gawker remained confidently convinced they would prevail as they had over so many other lawsuit--until it was too late. <br><br>The verdict would stun the world and so would Peter's ultimate unmasking as the man who had set it all in motion.

Growing up in the Deep South, where she was “home-schooled for hippie reasons,” she looked online to find her tribe. The Internet was in its infancy and she became an early adopter at every stage of its growth—finding joy and unlikely friendships in the emerging digital world. Her relative isolation meant that she could pursue passions like gaming, calculus, and 1930’s detective novels without shame. Because she had no idea how “uncool” she really was.<BR> <BR>But if it hadn’t been for her strange background—the awkwardness continued when she started college at sixteen, with Mom driving her to campus every day—she might never have had the naïve confidence to forge her own path. Like when she graduated as valedictorian with a math degree and then headed to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting despite having zero contacts. Or when she tired of being typecast as the crazy cat-lady secretary and decided to create her own web series before people in show business understood that online video could be more than just cats chasing laser pointers.<BR> <BR>Felicia’s rags-to-riches rise to Internet fame launched her career as one of the most influen­tial creators in new media. Ever candid, she opens up about the rough patches along the way, recounting battles with writer’s block, a full-blown gaming addiction, severe anxiety, and depression—and how she reinvented herself when overachieving became overwhelming.<BR> <BR>Showcasing Felicia’s “engaging and often hilarious voice” (<i>USA TODAY</i>), <i>You’re Never Weird on the Internet (Almost) </i>is proof that everyone should celebrate what makes them different and be brave enough to share it with the world, because anything is possible now—even for a digital misfit."}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Actors & Entertainers","id":"2328"},{"name":"Rich & Famous","id":"886494"},{"name":"Memoirs","id":"3048891"},{"name":"Scientists","id":"2426"},{"name":"Women","id":"2445"},{"name":"Humor & Entertainment","id":"86"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Felicia Day","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Touchstone Books","Creator":"Joss Whedon","EAN":"9781476785660","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9781476785660"},"Edition":"Reprint","Feature":"Touchstone Books","ISBN":"147678566X","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"837","Length":"550","Weight":"0","Width":"80"},"Label":"Touchstone","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1600","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$16.00"},"Manufacturer":"Touchstone","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"304","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"94","Length":"827","Weight":"84","Width":"543"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2016-04-19","Publisher":"Touchstone","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-19","Studio":"Touchstone","Title":"You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost): A Memoir"}}}},{"id":"0385347391","data":{"width":52,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":1087,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$10.87"},"asin":"0385347391","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Dataclysm-Identity-What-Online-Offline-Selves/dp/0385347391?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0385347391","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dataclysm-Identity-What-Online-Offline-Selves/dp/0385347391?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0385347391","salesRank":30567,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FfUkPRszL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"104"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FfUkPRszL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"324"},"title":"Dataclysm: Love, Sex, Race, and Identity--What Our Online Lives Tell Us about Our Offline Selves","similar":["0544556380","076118208X","0765379953","0452297877","0062390856","0553418831","0749450894","0062390864","0307951790","1479837245"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0385347391&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A15Z&v=2&sig=P0OrtKxOQcHx8%252FIMJGMGhVStLMtVoR6fs4NNmVfSdtc%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<b><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller</b><br><br>An audacious, irreverent investigation of human behavior—and a first look at a revolution in the making</b><br>  <br> Our personal data has been used to spy on us, hire and fire us, and sell us stuff we don’t need. In <i>Dataclysm</i>, Christian Rudder uses it to show us who we truly are. <br>  <br> For centuries, we’ve relied on polling or small-scale lab experiments to study human behavior. Today, a new approach is possible. As we live more of our lives online, researchers can finally observe us directly, in vast numbers, and without filters. Data scientists have become the new demographers.<br>  <br> In this daring and original book, Rudder explains how Facebook \"likes\" can predict, with surprising accuracy, a person’s sexual orientation and even intelligence; how attractive women receive exponentially more interview requests; and why you must have haters to be hot. He charts the rise and fall of America’s most reviled word through Google Search and examines the new dynamics of collaborative rage on Twitter. He shows how people express themselves, both privately and publicly. What is the least Asian thing you can say? Do people bathe more in Vermont or New Jersey? What do black women think about Simon & Garfunkel? (Hint: they don’t think about Simon & Garfunkel.) Rudder also traces human migration over time, showing how groups of people move from certain small towns to the same big cities across the globe. And he grapples with the challenge of maintaining privacy in a world where these explorations are possible.<br>  <br> Visually arresting and full of wit and insight, <i>Dataclysm</i> is a new way of seeing ourselves—a brilliant alchemy, in which math is made human and numbers become the narrative of our time.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"}],"browseNodes":[{"name":"Data Modeling & Design","id":"379382011"},{"name":"Website Analytics","id":"377897011"},{"name":"Social Media","id":"6133992011"},{"name":"Social Media for Business","id":"6133993011"},{"name":"Computers & Internet","id":"4461"},{"name":"Self-Help & Psychology","id":"4480"},{"name":"Social Psychology & Interactions","id":"11223"},{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","id":"226685"},{"name":"Statistics","id":"52161011"},{"name":"Sociology","id":"11288"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Christian Rudder","Binding":"Paperback","Brand":"Broadway Books","EAN":"9780385347396","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780385347396"},"Edition":"Reprint","Feature":"Broadway Books","ISBN":"0385347391","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"800","Length":"520","Weight":"81","Width":"87"},"Label":"Broadway Books","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"1700","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$17.00"},"Manufacturer":"Broadway Books","MPN":"illustrations","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"320","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"110","Length":"799","Weight":"95","Width":"520"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"illustrations","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2015-09-08","Publisher":"Broadway Books","ReleaseDate":"2015-09-08","Studio":"Broadway Books","Title":"Dataclysm: Love, Sex, Race, and Identity--What Our Online Lives Tell Us about Our Offline Selves"}}}},{"id":"0312243359","data":{"width":53.5,"height":80,"product":{"price":{"amount":937,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$9.37"},"asin":"0312243359","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Wish-Inform-Tomorrow-Killed-Families/dp/0312243359?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0312243359","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Wish-Inform-Tomorrow-Killed-Families/dp/0312243359?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0312243359","salesRank":6969,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ5fsINDL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"107"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ5fsINDL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"333"},"title":"We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda","similar":["0812995767","0385319940","1570755639","0312425031","0060856262","0691175969","0061582069","0465061516","0786715103","0470120150"],"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0312243359&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2018-09-06T05%3A59%3A15Z&v=2&sig=%252Bph%252BOhb4uo7R98neqUcx8kDvqXnFCWdjKpdPedRHL6c%253D","descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p><b>An unforgettable firsthand account of a people's response to genocide and what it tells us about humanity.</b></p><p>This remarkable debut book chronicles what has happened in Rwanda and neighboring states since 1994, when the Rwandan government called on everyone in the Hutu majority to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. Though the killing was low-tech--largely by machete--it was carried out at shocking speed: some 800,000 people were exterminated in a hundred days. A Tutsi pastor, in a letter to his church president, a Hutu, used the chilling phrase that gives Philip Gourevitch his title.</p><p>With keen dramatic intensity, Gourevitch frames the genesis and horror of Rwanda's \"genocidal logic\" in the anguish of its aftermath: the mass displacements, the temptations of revenge and the quest for justice, the impossibly crowded prisons and refugee camps. Through intimate portraits of Rwandans in all walks of life, he focuses on the psychological and political challenges of survival and on how the new leaders of postcolonial Africa went to war in the Congo when resurgent genocidal forces threatened to overrun central Africa.</p><p>Can a country composed largely of perpetrators and victims create a cohesive national society?
