# v-debug

The goal here is to experiment with various settings in the clustered layout.

The input is a graph. The UI should present rendered graph and allow interactive
parameters settings.

Parameters I want to explore:

1. Depth of the clustering algorithm
2. Layout settings inside a cluster
3. Layout settings between the clusters.
4. Orthogonal layout at the max zoom level.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start
```
